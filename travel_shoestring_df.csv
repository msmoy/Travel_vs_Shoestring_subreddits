1,Looking for a mini getaway trip.,"You’re traveling with your SO this Fall and have never been outside of NM, TX and LA. He enjoys driving, so a road trip could be fun, but don’t want more than 1 days worth.  

A healthy mixture of the nature scene (maybe something adventurous like jumping out of a helicopter, paragliding anything to give you an adrenaline rush), but also enjoy the night life so can’t be too far away (Maybe not more than 45 mins) from city night life. 

Here’s what you have to work with...
People: 2
Duration: 3-5 days 
Season: fall (early September to late December)
Budget: $1000-$2500 shared expenses


Is it best to rent a hotel, airbnb or camp through the getaway?
What options would you consider for food? How much would you budget to spend? 

I’m super new to planning and open to all of your suggestions!",Shoestring
2,Emergency travel - Standby ticket?,"Hi everyone,

My little sister was involved in a car accident across the country. I need to get there as soon as possible but flights are around $500 and I can't afford that. Are there any cheaper options for same-day or next-day travel? I can wait around the airport if need be. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: route is ATL to MSP

Edit 2: I called Delta, JetBlue, American and United. Everyone except delta said they don’t offer a bereavement fare and Delta said I was eligible for their bereavement fare but quoted me $1,968 when the online fare for the same flights runs at $551. I can’t say how much I appreciate the kind help and support from you all. Im going to keep looking and will update",Shoestring
3,Should I ditch my greyhound ticket for a plane one ?,"So I will be going on a trip soon, it's my first time ever really traveling, and I had decided to go by Greyhound.

13,Amsterdam,"Hiya,  


I don't normally do the more normal travell-y stuff (I hitchhike and camp in more rural places, don't spend much time in cities), so this sort of planning is out of my league. I'm meeting a few friends I haven't seen for years, and won't see for a while again in Amsterdam for 4 days in August. I wanted to spend more time in Amsterdam for a first visit, and suggested somewhere, but one of them has dreamed of going there since they were a child, so fair play to that.   


I'm not used to figuring out where to stay as a tourist. There's loads of options on airbnb and hostelworld, but it's a little overwhelming figuring out where is a good location. Personally I'd like to get out of amsterdam a bit, everyone says to make sure you see outside the center. So would it be sensible to stay somewhere cheaper out of the center? If it's no more than an hour to commute into the city, that might be acceptable for the others in a group. And it might make our costs better.. trying to keep things under £20 a night each for a bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on a nice area to look for accomodation that's not going to be a nightmare to get into the center to do the more typical attractions my friend will be interested in?

20,I will help you find you cheap flights for free since I have nothing else to do (again). ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"I have a hobby of aviation and finding cheap airfare. I thought rather than just looking at random flights I could do something fun and pay something forward. Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. 

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30 is better than ""Late July""

I'm M(24) based out of Atlanta and looking to take  my first solo trip in September for the Labor Day weekend (8/30 through 9/2). I have never been to the west coast so I my preference lies there. I am okay to save costs by staying in hostels, etc but open to spending the $ for a good experience. 

I would like to explore a major city and do a day long hike in a state/national park.

50,Question: Keeping costs low in Se Asia / when to splurge,"Hi, 

I've been travelling China for the last month, and am travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand until near the end of August. After that, I am starting an exchange in Hong Kong. I have a decent amount of money saved for my exchange and subsequent travels, but I only budgeted around 3k for my three months in Se Asia. I've been pretty good about sticking to my budget for accom/food/transport, but I did have a few of unexpected expenses including needing to buy a new camera lens because my original one was damaged (300), I had to buy an exit flight before boarding the plane to China (200) and I had to pay to expedite my Vietnamese visa before I left (which I didn't even up needing because I flew into Hanoi instead of crossing overland as planned, so I could have gone with the cheaper visa on arrival!) 

Anyway, my problem is.. I want to stick to my budget as closely as possible, which means about 20/day ish for the remainder - but I don't want to give up too many activities. So, I was wondering if people had tips for living making the most out of a small budget. Like what activities are worth splurging on (like i just did a ha long bay cruise and it was def worth it) and what cheaper activities are often overlooked (like... treks in national parks? motorbiking around rice fields?) 

So far my favourite things so far on this trip have been walking the great wall, eating street food in shanghai, hiking zhangjiajie, ha long bay (and swimming with the bioluminescent plankton), and exploring cafes in hanoi... I def lean towards like outdoorsy activities; swimming, hiking and kayaking, but i love a bit of food tourism too. 

Specifically, what do you think of the following activities:

\- diving course: is it worth the cost and where is the best place to do it for the best experience.  (vietnam? thailand?) 

\- elephant sanctuary. I def wanna see some elepahnts, but i want it to be ethical! where was your best value for money experience. I'm considering mondulkiri project in cambodia or one of the most popular sanctuaries in thailand)

\- any other activities that you think are worth splurging on  (rock climbing, ziplining, massages?) 

\- similarly, what are places worth staying at with good free activities. i'm pretty keen on the idea of staying at a good beach (or other place with good free activities?) for a week or so and just swimming / exploring / eating pineapple, so my only expenses are accommodation and food. What are the best beaches for this in Vietnam/ Cambodia/ Thai Islands? 

If you have any other suggestions for keeping costs low without sacrificing experiences, let me know! 

TL;DR: What are the activities in SE Asia that should not be sacrificed in order to save money? (and vice versa)",Shoestring

55,TIL an airplane is not like a bus,"So I booked a ticket from Chongqing --&gt; HongKong --&gt; JFK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having booked the ticket from Guangxi, I'd have to make my way to Chongqing to catch the flight. So I thought, I might as well just take the train to Hong Kong and catch the second flight from there. So I did. I thought I'd just walk up to the gate in HKIA and hop on the plane and nobody would care nor ask about my absence from the first flight. Well guess what? They did. 

&amp;#x200B;

So apparently it's the policy of *all airlines* that a booked ticket must be taken from the very first flight, or otherwise the rest of the trip will be automatically cancelled (it's in the small print at the end of the confirmation email). 

I'm taking full accountability here, and not posting here to bitch about the system (although, yes it would be nice if that were not the case). I just thought I'd share my experience here to prevent any naive individuals like myself from making the same mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're curious about the end of the story: after (regrettably) arguing with customer service of both the airline and Trip.com for around 30 minutes, I let it go, booked a new, cheaper, ticket from HK to JFK for later that day, accepted the partial refund for my first flight which amounted to around 40% of the ticket, and went on my way.

59,Just back from Stockholm not the cheapest place) some tips for doing it on a budget,"1. Investing in a public transport pass is a good move. It cost £23 for 72 hours which seems quite high but the network is massive. You can even get to the archipelago on it (an island called Vaxholm) Will add it doesn't include airport but flixbus is cheap for that.
2. Last point leads on to next one, don't stay in the Old Town/City Centre choose somewhere close to a Tunnelbanna then you can save money on lodgings, plus there are usually more interesting places in the less touristy areas. I personally stayed in Sodermalm right near Skanstull and would highly recommend. It was less than 10 mins to get to Gamla Stan from there
3. Try to stay somewhere with kitchen facilities, the supermarkets are good so you can save money by making picnics. Wilys and Lidl were the cheapest ones. I think on eating/drinking out the same advice applies anywhere in the world- its always going to be way more expensive in an ultra-touristy part of the city.
4. I found quite a few bars that were not very expensive (could get a 40cl beer for under £4 ) sadly most of them did not really have the atmosphere you'd want (not awful but not great) I would however recommend Carmen on Tjärhovsgatan (Sodermalm) totally no frills but in a good way, apparently its the 1 cheap place the young cool locals go

87,The bus ride from hell (Ourbus),"Good afternoon everyone, I apologize if this isn't the place to share this but since it involves me trying to travel cheaply I thought it best to give a warning. 

Today I hopped on a bus from Norfolk, VA to New York, NY with the ultimate destination being Boston, MA. Grand total? $37 USD before taxes. Score right? I booked my first bus to NY through Ourbus because they offered sokid amenities(A/C, Water, Wi-Fi and clean restroom. So I showed up and waited. The bus was maybe 5 minutes late so not to bad. I hope on and the first thing I notice is heat. Not just warm. But full pitstains hot. I try to adjust my AC vent to find that it's not blowing, it had broken. Oh well, we pop the roof vents and occasionally get some air. I ask for some water, they're out. Frustrating but I came prepared. I try to get on the Wi-Fi when we hit the rural areas. I'm sure you can guess what happened, no luck. Despite the losing 8 pounds in sweat I still have to utilize the facilities. I stepped in, backed out, and held it for 9 hours. At some point we get roughly a half hour behind. Then the driver decided to stop for a smoke break. . . for a half hour. So for a half hour we say on the oven of a bus so this guy could smoke. Ya know what. Oh well. I had an hour and 10 minute gap because I know stuff happens. Well apparently at this point he realizes we're late and begins driving very aggressively. Give you a nickel if you can guess what happens next. If you guessed he hit a car, you'd be correct. At this point I've missed my connecting bus by half an hour. And he spends another half hour fighting with this chick who was holding onto his phone until the police arrive when one of the other passengers just snatches his phone back and he leaves the scene of an accident. Goes maybe 300 yards and halfway up an exit to let passengers who are done with this off. Then crosses the double white lines back into the freeway. Another half hour and I'm finally at the stop. Now I needed to get to Boston tonight and I'll be demand if I'm getting on another bus. So I jog down to Penn station and spend $145.80 on a train ticket (that's with military discount) and pretty much just suck up the $10 loss on a Megabus ticket I didn't get to use. So I play phone tag with these guys, three calls, various IMs on their website and emails and it's not until I mention that the press should be made aware that they give me a whopping 27 dollars. . . of credit. After politely explaining that I'd rather walk from VA to NY on broken glass they said they'd look into it. Theoretically they'll get back to me by noon tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath. If there's interest I'll update this. Apologies for errors writing on mobile from a train.

115,What are some tips you have for saving money while doing the Pan American highway?,"Let me start off with saying, this trip is at best a couple years away, but I really enjoy the planning phases of a trip and I always love learning about new things I can use while traveling, so that’s why I’m asking so early. 

I am hoping to do the pan American highway in a Jeep Wrangler (probably a 2 door, not sure yet though) over 3 years (36 months) but if I can make my budget last I wouldn’t hesitate to stay longer and use up all of my budget on such a trip. The plan is to camp, cook my own meals when it makes sense and really not party to save money. I’m already not much into drinking and I’m not going to get involved in any sort of drugs. 

Ideally I would like to visit every country in the America’s except for Venezuela, so this includes Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. I’m really not sure what more information I can provide lol, I of course want to see all of the main attractions while I’m there but I also want to go get far away from the tourist circuit as well. 

Budget wise in my mind I’m hoping I could easily stick to 12k CAD (9k USD) per year. So far I have heard from two people that have done the pan American highway and one managed a budget of 27k USD for two years everything included (seems a bit high to me..) and another who did 3 years in 40k CAD, but he admits he splurged a few times each costing him hundreds/thousands (like his trip to Easter island, scuba diving courses I believe and Galápagos Islands) he said had he been a bit more budget conscious he thinks he could have easily done it on 12k CAD/year which is where I’m getting my estimates from primarily. 

I don’t think I’d be interested in working while there, but at the same time I could try working a bit at a hostel to save on accommodation whenever I feel like staying in a hostel and get tired of camping. 

Any ideas on how to save money on such a trip? If you’ve actually done the panamerican yourself I would greatly appreciate your responses in particular and I’d love to hear what kind of budget you managed yourself!",Shoestring

128,Visiting Spain for a week!,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend are planning on visiting Spain in August. We have not decided flight dates yet but it will probably be in the first weeks of the month. We're from Portugal so flight costs aren't *a big deal* (given that the flights cost around \~50€ total for each person) but we're a bit stale on what to actually visit. Our idea was to go straight to Madrid and stay there for a couple of days (perhaps even 1 or 2 more days) and then catch a train to Valencia (pictures online were marvelous). 

&amp;#x200B;

Our vacation idea isn't really a *hit the beach and relax* type of thing but we would like to mix that with visiting historic monuments (our first idea was to hit Rome but we didn't manage to make it, perhaps another time). From what I saw, I'm not really sure if Madrid is the type of city you'd want to visit in order to see monuments and such (it seems like Madrid is a commercial city, with no **big** history judging by the pictures/reviews I saw online - kinda like Milan). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nontheless, even I'm wrong and Madrid (and Valencia) **is** indeed a beautiful city to visit, I would like to get people's opinions on reserving hotel rooms online (trivago or booking are **most likely** our only options since they are the most known companies here). Is it safe given that these companies work as middle-men between you and the actual hotel? Isn't it better to straight up call the hotel and make a reservation? (is it more expensive?)

&amp;#x200B;

And what about train tickets? Is *thetrainline* website a safe place to buy them? Anything we need to take into account?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also be open to suggestions about others cities rather than the ones we planned on going. Barcelona isn't really a choice since my girlfriend has been there for 3 times now and I really don't want to make her re-visit almost everything again, perhaps on a later date.",Shoestring

132,Disney World or Abroad Vacation?,"My husband and I are wanting to go our our honeymoon sometime this fall. The wedding really drained our bank accounts so we've had to wait a year to save up to go somewhere, but we're still pretty low on funds. The original plan was to go to Disney because I have never been before, but I am worried that's going to still be too expensive to make work. I was told that going out of country for a honeymoon would actually be less expensive than in country so now we're considering that as well. So I'm wondering which you think would be a better deal? Disney World or Abroad somewhere nice?

&amp;#x200B;

Some other possibly important info:

We live in Kentucky

We want at least a good part of this vacation to be relaxing, not adventure based

We want to stay at least a week, possibly longer

If we go to Disney we would also want to go to Universal at least for a day

We would greatly appreciate literally any tips for either Honeymoon option

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are saying abroad, which is great and all but I also would like to know suggestions for where to travel exactly. Abroad is much more vast than Disney so I wouldn't even know where to start.

Edit 2: Some corrections: I understand the Disney Park is not relaxing. If we pick Disney we plan on spending a good amount of time on the beach or at a friends condo (that has a pool) as well as at the parks. We would also drive down seeing as Florida actually isn’t that far from us and like I said, we have a place to stay for cheap. My budget is not $1000 as assumed by a lot of people. We have about $1200 give or take saved right now but still have time to save more as well as a credit card we already have designated for travel.",Shoestring

* should we spend more days on the mainland or Islands 
* Which Island/s should we go to. My Friend wants to go to Santorini, but I'm leaning more towards Ios, But that's only from our 2ish days of looking online, so any other suggestions are helpful.   
* How on Gods green earth does the Greek ferry system work? One source says its a cheap, 45-minute ferry to Santorini, and then another tells me it will take 8 hours and 100 euro one way, what even is consitency.   
* whats some cool things to do, both on the mainland and islands, on the cheap.

 I will be in Malaysian Borneo first, and have flexibility to get to Sulawesi from any main airport there- but it seems like I can only find flights that go to Monado, Sulawesi from KL/Jakarta.  I can’t find any flights from Air Asia and the cheapest ones I can find are in the $250 Canadian dollars range.  

Is there a cheaper way overland? Say crossing the border to Kalimantan and flying from there?  Or is my best option to fly from a main airport and bite the $250 dollar bullet? I am slightly pressed for time, unfortunately.

153,Traveled to Barcelona and Paris things I wish I would’ve known,"So for context I travelled from my city in the US through a connected international flight to Barcelona, from Barcelona to Paris, and then back to the US through a connected flight.

**Before you leave**

* I would exchange currency in the US, go IN ADVANCE to a big bank (Chase, Wells Fargo etc...) and request it. You can lose a big percentage if you exchange at the European airport exchange place or at certain exchange places in Barcelona. I cannot stress this enough look up the reviews for the exchange places and ask what the rates are, I went to what looked like a decent place with asian ladies, and got 30% of my value ripped off and I didn’t know I got hustled until it was too late. The place also had a 1 star on google reviews...
* Pack plenty of clothes and underwear, for the guys, have plenty of shirts and cut down on pants with shorts as you can use them multiple times. Definitely pack enough socks &amp; underwear especially if you are doing a beach day or something. Good comfortable shoes, if you want to do it all, you have to walk a lot.

**Flights**

* If you’re traveling through united (economy) you’re allowed a checked in bag for free, and a carry on, plus a backpack (as long as its not gigantic).
* They weren’t checking our carry on dimension wise leaving from the US, but they will from Barcelona to Paris, don’t over do your carry on make it look as small as possible.
* This is a big one, plan for the fact that traveling in Europe won’t grant you the same luggage as traveling from the US to Europe. As in traveling from Barcelona to Paris, you’re only allowed your checked in bag, and carry on ONLY. If you have anything else, they will charge you a 60 euro fine. The fine also applies to being overweight with your checked in bag so keep that in mind.
* When traveling back to the US, you have to understand that the TSA are not nice, and to keep your snacks food, whatever in your checked in bag, and do clothes only or non-edible in your carry on to avoid any problems.
* This is something I found at the airports and it can come in handy. You’re not allowed water bottles until you reach your gate at the airport terminals. So carry an empty water bottle, or a water bottle in your carry on (backpack). They have water fountains at the Barcelona, Paris, and Newark airports, whereas a sold water will cost you at least $2.50.
* My first time flying through a connected flight, they can the gates so watch out for that.

**Barcelona**

* It was so fun 😩😩🙌😊
* Perfect if you’re a uni student and want to go have fun
* Almost everybody speaks descent English, and if you speak Spanish its even better
* The whole city is run down with American uni students, and Americans in general so literally everytime someone bumped in to me it was a “I’m sorry” never a perdon.
* Get a metro pass for the time that you will be there, also they close the metro past a certain hour but you can use the bus, show them your metro card and ride for free
* The hours are really cool, a lot of places (pinchos restaurants) open up at 10:30 pm and close at 2:30 am
* So many attractions and things to do
* Never encountered the “ciesta” maybe its not followed in Barça
* Relatively inexpensive food (1 euro pinchos), and good :)
* Relatively inexpensive drinks, also a rule in the city you can’t buy alcohol after 11pm
* What to watch out for: if people outside of a place are trying really hard to get you to go, don’t. Tables outside are cute but its not descent food, and way to expensive. There was a big plaza (or cathedral) with restaurants all around it, avoid it. The descent places will be more hidden or you can try google maps.
* I never really felt unsafe, except for that one time we got lost in shady place, but literally all the time as long if you travel with people you are 100% fine. If you’re really late lots of street vendors will come up to you and try to sell you shit which is kind of annoying.

**Paris**

* Not a party city I would say, definitely more for couples
* Subway more complicated than the one in Barça they don’t call out the stops you have to look at the walls and see the name of the stop painted to know where you are.
* Museums are really good, but make sure you have tickets for the Louvre ahead of time (get them online), and that goes for the Palace of Versailles as well, I don’t recommend the catacombs waste of time outside. Do the big museums, Eiffel tower summit, Arch (have to buy a ticket to go to rooftop again online), Versailles palace + gardens (the gardens made the trip worth it), visit Notre Dame, gardens, and walk around the museum district.
* Food A LOT more expensive and not as good as the one in Barça (expect to eat crêpes)
* Everything is just more expensive, and beer very limited, they offer rosé or white wine, free water at most restaurants unlike in Barça
* Hours for food are kind of bad, most places close at 3 pm, then open up at 7 pm and close at midnight. Past midnight everything is pretty much closed.
* English is very limited here, and locals don’t like the fact that they have to speak English, and you not French
* Holy shit I almost forgot. If you’re carrying heavy luggage don’t take a train from the airport, plan ahead it will be a nightmare. A lot of steps, not worth it.
* VALIDATE YOUR TRAIN PASS AT THE MACHINE, the machines are in French and don’t make this explicit. If you buy a 5 day subway pass, validate it by inputing it into the machine itself where it will stamp a date on it, officially validating it, if the police stop you without you doing this will be a big issue. Also get the printed receipt just in case.
* Not as safe as in Barcelona I would say, but I never felt in danger. Always be in a group when traveling especially at night, near the big attractions.

My friend and I are planning on doing a 2 week trip to Austria. We have a budget and when looking at flights, checking in baggage is too expensive (like $160 roundtrip each). We planned on just checking one bag, but now we just rather take a backpack and a carry on each.

Carry on limits, according to the website I am getting tickets from ([Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com), which gets info from the airlines, I believe), is 7 kg. The return trip is 8 kg.

I just packed my carry-on bag as if I were traveling tomorrow (without packing toiletry bag, a sweater, and little misc items like belts) and the bag weighed 7.5 kg already. We want to have our backpacks as empty as possible to pack the items we buy during the trip.

Supposing the carry on bags weigh 9 kg or 10 kg when traveling, is this going to be a big deal? How strict are airlines with this? Do they weigh the bag?

I imagine low-cost airlines may be more strict... does anyone has experience with Norweigan, XL France, Laudamotion, EuroWings, Austrian Air? Those are airlines serving the flights we are looking at.

We just want to save money and have enough for the actual trip, and I can't believe that 2 kg or 3 kg would be a reason to make us check a small bag. Also, I have had check-in people not weigh my carry-on bag before, and when they do, I have had them not care about an excess of a kilogram or two. Should I expect the same from the airlines I mentioned?

180,How to do Latin America in 6 months? Advice por favor...,"So, I've decided to leave the USA and go on an adventure starting in about month.

Looking for advice for where/what to do for about 6 months...

&amp;#x200B;

A couple things about me:

1) 31M USA

2) Speak decent level of spanish

3) Got a solid savings, but I'd prefer to keep monthly spending to around $2000 USD. 

4) Pretty open-minded. Also, in good physical condition so I'm open to outdoor stuff. 

5) I love making music and films. So I will want to bring my equipment, at least, my camera, gimbal and lenses. Trying to make a decision on baggage. 

6) Enjoy walking outside, eating street food, taking a beer/coffee. 

7) Open to staying in places for extensive periods of time. 

8) I've been in Mexico and Costa Rica recently and loved it. Although, I'd prefer to explore further south (Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Argentina...)

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a realllyyyy open-ended question. Guess that's the point. But, if you had to recommend some places I absolutely must-see or at least stay for a few weeks. It would be a pleasure to hear what you've got. :)

182,2 months in South East Asia/China for £1800 - advice needed.,"Hey guys, I posted something here a few days ago and got some really helpful responses so I thought I'd ask for some more advice:

I've (22M) decided to go to South East Asia (Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam) and China, leaving next month. My budget is \~£1800 for everything and I'm based in UK. Ideally I'd like to spend 1 month in SEA and then 3 weeks to a month in China.  I was planning on starting at Bangkok, then making my way through Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh, HCM city, Hanoi, then across the Chinese coast up to Shenzhen.

I hear SEA (especially Vietnam and Cambodia) is very doable money-wise but I hear different things about China so if anyone has some experience and could comment on how feasible this budget is/suggest some changes I'd appreciate it. 

Also, what are some cool landmarks/places between Hanoi and Shenzhen that you would suggest?

My initial thought was to travel to Bolivia to see an old friend and visit the Uyuni salt flats. Then I thought maybe Medellin because I’m also 1/2 Colombian and I’ve heard that New Years there is amazing — though, I don’t know anyone there. (I’ve already been to other Colombian cities, but never Medellin.) My third thought is that I should just take it easy and spend the full two weeks in Peru getting to know family and exploring more of the country.

192,Is it tacky or inappropriate to fill up a flask from the free-flowing coffee station in a restaurant?,"When we first traveled together, SO &amp; I easily spent 20e on our first day on coffee (expensive European city, horrible coffee, but coffee is life, so..).

We will be traveling together again in a few weeks. We're working on a budget now and he put in 30e for coffee for three days! Que horror! Lol!

He said that it's inappropriate and that he'd walk out if I did that. He also said that people will stare and the staff may not say anything but they will certainly talk about me.

I'm just meh about it because for me it boils down to saving some that can be better spent on other things. And I rationalized it as, it's free-flowing, drink all you can anyways, so what difference does it make if you drink it there or take it with you?

196,We took a two-week honeymoon in Europe for $3600. Here's our budget!,"My hubby and I recently tied the knot. We're recent college grads and don't have much savings yet, so we decided to forgo a traditional wedding in favor of eloping and going on a nice honeymoon together. We managed to keep everything under $4000 USD without sacrificing our overall enjoyment of the vacation. Here's an overview of the trip:

* Origin: United States (east coat)
* Glasgow, Scotland (4 days)
* Edinburgh, Scotland (4 days)
* Dublin, Ireland (5 days)
* Reykjavik, Iceland (3 days)

And here is a breakdown of our spending over the course of 16 days (rounded for easier math):

* **Accomodations: $850.** We stayed  in AirBnB's. In most cases we had a private room with shared kitchen/living area, and in Iceland we had our own ""tiny home.""
* **Airfare: $870.** Our long-haul flights were $790 (Icelandair with a free 3-day stopover) and we also took an $80 Ryanair flight to Dublin. What really kept our cost down was not having any checked bags. We brought 40L backpacks as our carry-ons.
* **Local transport: $670.** This includes Ubers to our airport and back (cheaper than parking fees), local buses, trains for day trips and to get to Edinburgh, and our rental car in Iceland (plus insurance/gas/parking). We also took a couple of Ubers to make it easier to find our AirBnBs from the airport.
* **Food: $900.** We averaged around $55 per day. We typically just ate out one meal per day (usually lunch) and cooked everything else in our AirBnB. We both don't like to drink a lot of alcohol, so that definitely helped to keep the cost down.
* **Attractions: $240.** Personally we like to to spend most of our time exploring nature and checking out historical sites, so we avoided a lot of the pricey touristy stuff. Of course there were a few must-see sights that we paid to go to, including Edinburgh Castle, the Guiness Brewery, the Irish Whiskey Museum, and Iceland's Secret Lagoon. This also includes tips for a few free walking tours that we went on.
* **International medical insurance: $50**. Just a basic package.

**That brings our total cost to roughly $3600**. We're very happy to have come out under budget, especially when we really did not feel like we were skimping. It was definitely not a ""luxurious"" vacation but we had a ton of fun and made some lifelong memories. I'll summarize by just giving a few tips to help others save some money on their travels.

* Be flexible with your destination. We knew we wanted to fly to Europe with Icelandair to take advantage of their free stopover, but we weren't committed to a specific destination in Europe. We researched which cities were cheapest to fly into and out of, and kept our eyes peeled for good deals.
* Skip the international phone plans. We just used wifi and were completely fine. Pro tip: you can use location services without any data!
* Don't eat out too much. While food is an important part of travel, we didn't mind cooking a lot of our meals. It saved us a lot of money and also is something we enjoy doing to wind down at the end of the day.
* Take advantage of free attractions, like walking tours, hikes, museusm, etc.",Shoestring

203,My Favourite Five - New York,"Hey everyone. I wrote up a list a while ago of my favourite five things to do in New York, with a focus on the many free and super cheap things you can do. I thought maybe some people here might be interested and comparing notes.  Anyway, here it is below:

**My Favourite Five - New York**

New York is a pretty popular place. It is a very common place to celebrate New Years Eve there. There is lots to do, and unless you are there for a while, you can't possibly cover it all. But, you can try. So, let’s take a look at **My Favourite Five** places in New York.  


**1. American Museum of Natural History**  
Located near Central Park, this museum is huge. It has such a large variety of things to go see. There are different sections covering major groups of organisms. There is a set of mammal halls, reptile halls and a whole section on humans and their cultural evolution. Plus no visit is complete without the obligatory dinosaur section. You could literally spend hours there. Days even, if you are so inclined.  
Now here is the reason why you are reading this. For my fellow travellers who like to live on the cheap, this is the place for you. If you buy the ticket online, the cost is about 23 USD. So you don’t buy it online.  
They have a pay-what-you-like policy at the counter. So, essentially you choose how much your ticket costs. You can pay a dollar if you like or the full price or anything in between. Maybe you could even pay more, but I am not sure how many people do that. I mean, the idea is to pay what you are capable to help them maintain the massive amount of important specimens that they store. But let’s face it, when you are on the road, most days you have to decide between food and visiting a location. It is nice to visit a museum and not feel sick from the ticket price, knowing you are going to be on salt and rice for the next two weeks to maintain your budget. So, take my advice, don’t pay in advance. Save some cash. Even if you hate museums, it is a good place to go when you can't wander around due to the bad weather. So keep it on your list.  


**2. Statue of Liberty**  
When I was there, the statue was closed due to damage from a recent storm. But, you can’t go to New York and not see the thing. Not because it was particularly amazing or anything. You have to see it, so that you don’t have to spend the next 40 years explaining why you didn’t, every time New York comes up in a conversation. While travelling, you are supposed to have freedom. But sometimes small sacrifices of time and effort have to be made to protect you from crap in the future. The statue is cool, but there is so much in New York, that I would forgive you for not going seeing it.  
The easiest way is to purchase an official ticket. You can go on to the island, walk around, take photos and all that. It seems alright. With the right ticket, you can actually climb inside and hang out in the head. I had originally planned to do that myself, but couldn't use the ticket due to the storm.  
If you don’t want to pay, there is another way though. You won’t get as close and you won’t stop on the island. But if you take the free ferry to Staten Island, it will go past the statue and you can hang out and take a photo from there. You won't get super close. But it is much better than trying from the shore. If you have a good enough camera, people won’t even know that you didn’t pay. The ferry leaves from Whitehall Street. Just be cool though. The timetables are marked with yellow for the times when it is peak hour for residents returning home after a hard day at work. Try to take a ferry that does not coincide with that and you will not have to deal with the wrath of the native New Yorker. They can be pretty scary.  
Just remember, it is free. Free. Free. Free. Man, I love free stuff.  


**3. Shows. Shows. Shows.**  
Lots of those iconic variety shows that are popular on the Youtubes (that's how you spell it right?) are actually recorded in New York. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Myers, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. All interesting and worth a look. They always need an audience. You can more often than not get tickets for free. I went to see David Letterman filmed, back when he was doing his thing. It was an interesting experience to take a look behind the scenes. I never intended to go, actually. I was simply stopped by staff as I passed the building it was going to be filmed at and asked if I would like to join in. No cost? Free stuff? Sure, let me in.  
Nowadays, it seems that you can book your tickets online. There may be the ability to get tickets out the front of some of the studios, but I would try and secure a ticket online first before trying your luck elsewhere. Each show has different schedules, but have a look at the ones you are interested in and you can find the information pretty easily.  
I found [this website ](https://www.nycgo.com/articles/tv-show-tapings)that has some information, though I am unsure exactly how up to date it is. It at least gives you an idea and points you in the right direction for a lot of your favourite shows. Free. Free. Free.  


**4. Central Park**  
Another free thing? I know, right? You thought New York was going to be expensive. It is. Don’t be disillusioned. You will pay a hell of a lot of money just to sleep there. They would tax you for breathing, if they could. Food, drinks, transport are all going to add up. So, this is why I am giving you as much free options as possible. I like you. I don't want you to starve. 

New York is a big, tough town. To get anywhere, you have to fight through a mass of people and traffic. The noise can be deafening. So, to have a place where you can go and hide from all that chaos, just for a little while, is a valuable thing.  
The park is huge and it is almost impossible not to find a little spot for yourself. All around the park are some pretty nice places to visit. The Natural History Museum mentioned in part one is just one example. For you iPhone lovers out there, the Apple store is pretty near by too.  
My favourite thing to see there, was the squirrels. I had heard so much about them but never seen one in real life. It was cool to see them scattering around, jumping and climbing trees. I liked to just watch them and see where they went to. It was almost meditative.  
Anyway, if you are bored and the advertisement assault that is Time Square does not catch your fancy, then this is maybe a place for you to hang out. Plus in winter, they set up little ice skating rinks which is a nice little activity.  


**5. I’m walkin’ here!**  
I could go on with hundreds of epic locations. But the best thing about New York is that it is so big that the act of exploring is just as fun as any one location. Taking wanders through the many streets will net you a heap of cool discoveries that you would never have found. It will also give you the feeling of making your own holiday and not always just following what the top 10 on Lonely Planet say. I really recommend just putting the map in your back pocket, choosing a direction at random and walking. The temptation to look at the map will be strong, but try and hold off, just wander and see what comes your way.  
Of course, doing this at night is not recommended. But if you start from Time Square and just go from there, you can find lots of cool things. Adventure awaits you.  


**Additional:**  


As I said, there is so much going on here, so I don’t want to bombard you with too much stuff. But one piece of advice I give all people going to New York is to consider the 32 USD weekly subway ticket. New York is so big that sometimes, even with the best intentions, your feet just refuse to keep going. You try to negotiate with them, but they just won't budge. At times like this, having that ticket handy just makes life so much better. Also, the subway really is a cool experience all its own and is a pretty iconic aspect of New York. You should at least ride it once.  
Also, as I already mentioned the Central Park, I won’t do a full thing on this, but the “High Line” walking track is really nice too. Built on an old railway system, it stands well above the ground floor and can give you some nice views of the Hudson.

You can find it [here](https://www.dgreenwoodbooks.com/theothersideoftravelling/my-favourite-five-new-york) if you want some pictures with your reading, otherwise I hope you got some useful hints.

2) From users who have gotten cheap internationals, when would be the best time to try to get cheap flights that are scheduled almost a year in advance?

207,7 nights August trip: Havana or NYC on a budget?,"I know, two different things. Let me explain:

I'm meeting my SO for the first time (long distance relationship), she lives in the US and I live in Europe. We agreed to meet in her country or somewhere close. From my home country, I can find cheap tickets only for the cities mentioned in the title.  For NYC,we will be staying in Long Island City and not in Manhattan(will it be a bad experience?). For either Cuba or NYC, after flight tickets and accomondation, we will have 100$/day per person. We don't drink, we don't go to parties. We love beaches. We don't mind eating fast food in NYC. We like both Havana and NYC and we can't decide.

Cuba seems cheap, is it cheap though? Is the 15-18hour(for me)  trip to Cuba worth it? Or should we stick to the other option? Where will we have more fun?

Thank you!

**Edit:**

I apologize for not making it clear and confusing you, what I meant about LIC is that we will just use LIC(specifically Queens) to stay cheaper instead of staying in Manhattan, but our main interest is Manhattan.

I'm thinking,despite the fact that Cuba is cheaper,maybe we should choose NYC to avoid any troubles with the travel rescrictions?

Could you tell me what would we be able to do with that budget in NYC? We're more interested in sightseeing,shows,trips etc rather than expensive restaurants,drinking etc.

I'd love to go to Cuba but I'm trying to see if it'll be really much better than NYC because 16-18h trip x2 just for 7 nights won't be the best thing for me.

Mexico for now is impossible for me. Tickets start from 1400$ while Cuba and NY is 700-800$. Any other destinations where we'd have fun with that budget?

**Edit 2:** 

We finally decided to go to NYC and avoid any hassles with the travel restrictions in Cuba. It's also less travel time for both of us. And safer in a way, I can't imagine what happens if anything happens and we need money but can't access it. It seems that there is actually a lot to do in NYC despite our low budget.

It might not be as good as it'd be in Cuba but if everything goes well, we'll consider going in Havana in our next trip - when we will have more time to plan for it. It might not be the best choice, maybe we won't do everything we're dreaming of in NYC, but in the end we'll meet and I think that's what matters. I want to thank you all for taking the time to help us, we really appreciate it! Once again,thank you all!",Shoestring

217,Traveling from US to the Balkans - any advice I can get,"Hello! So I recently decided to take a trip to Europe within the next 6 months or so. I'm very interested in the Balkans,  specifically Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Apparently these countries are very affordable to travel within and I've always been interested in the area. However,  searching for plane tickets has been discouraging. It would be a while before I would actually purchase any tickets, but I'm trying to get an idea of prices and such.

Several websites either list no flights from my nearest airport (SDF in Louisville) or give prices around $3000 as the cheapest. How would you suggest searching for flights to places like this? Is it just unrealistic to expect to find round trip flights to the Balkans for less than $1000? Would I be better off focusing on more mainstream destinations like the UK, Germany, or Scandinavia?

I've been to Europe a few times. Two years ago I spent about a month in the Western Balkans - Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro - and I'd sort of like to pick up where I left off there and see what's further east. I want to go places I haven't been before, and aren't too expensive. I like old Soviet shit and remote, hard-to-get-to places

I do have a few ideas: 

a) head east to the Black Sea through Romania, then up to Moldova and Ukraine, or 

b) hang around Hungary/Slovakia/Poland for a while and then Belarus and Ukraine, or

c) the Southern Balkans countries (Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia) and maybe Bulgaria if time permits

Me and my girlfriend will be travelling to the States to work at a summer camp over summer, and we have 15 days after camp ends to travel.

This includes transport, accommodation, food, everything. We don't want to stay in expensive hotels or anything, but also don't really want dirt cheap hostels that are basically a bed and that's it. 

We have a semi-solid plan of staying in NYC the first 5 days and we are looking at Airbnbs in New Jersey so we could just get a bus/train to NYC. So far we've found ones going for around $80 a night that are still decent but not too expensive. I've also had a look at Couchsurfing and personally I don't mind doing it but my gf is a bit suspicious of staying at people's houses for free so I doubt I can convince her to do it to save money. 

But afterwards is still a bit up in the air, haven't decided when to go to DC or any other places. Are there any other cities near NYC that are cheap but still with lots to do? We have no real preference of what to do/see but basically want to do as much while spending as little as possible. I am happy to answer any questions or give further info if it helps.

The first mistake we made that is too late to change is that we booked the trip (Paris and London) for 17 days (15 days if travel is not included). I am terrified that I may be returning in debt due to this length and though I am financially cautious, I am worried about food and transportation costs. 

In terms of logistics we had a budget of $2,000 and have already paid $1,600 for flight, main transportation between the two cities, and airbnb. I was planning on budgeting 500$ for food, but after doing so much research I don’t know if that is sufficient. My friend and I are also planning on cooking and buying from grocery stores for most of our stay however.

The mistakes we have made thus far with planning this trip is making me wonder if my friend and I are even capable of traveling. As much as I want to cancel the trip, our flight booking company charges a fee that is almost equivalent to the flight. I am so stressed! London and Paris are two cities I have dreamed of traveling since little and I started saving up money as soon as I got a job and realized that doing a study abroad was too expensive for me. I’m a big history nerd and have been taking classes that cover the history of both countries, so it makes me sad that I am stressed to go. 

This would be my first time in Europe so I have no idea what to expect. I don’t know what to do? Should I cancel the trip? 

Something that I probably should look forward to and enjoy has been stressing me out to the point that I get dizzy and want to vomit. Any advice on what I should do?",Shoestring

275,Tips for travelling to US cities on a small budget (Chicago),"Hey everyone! I’ve always been interested in travelling and seeing new places but haven’t really been able to for various reasons. Long story short, I have a car now and some money so I figured I might try to take a weekend trip to a new city. I’m thinking of driving about 7 hours to either Chicago or New York (probably Chicago). Obviously gas won’t be cheap, so I’d like to keep the cost of where to stay pretty low. Considering that I just graduated high shcool and am going to college next year, I don’t really have a lot of money to go all out with any potential trips. I’m very unfamiliar with planning this type of stuff. Is AirBnB the way to go? Hostels? And any tips on how to find the best deals without staying somewhere completely sketchy?


Besides where to stay, I imagine I’d be fine on money. Im mainly into history and architecture so I could probably do a lot of self guided tours and such. But yeah if anyone has any suggestions regarding how to make where to stay affordable, that would be great! Thanks!",Shoestring

--



Hi, r/shoestring!

First off, massive thank you to the mods for allowing me to post this.

I mod over at r/solotravel and we'd like to invite you to an upcoming AMA with Alex from [Lost with Purpose] (https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/) taking place this Saturday, May 18th! Alex has been budget-traveling around the world for a few years, hitting up all sorts of amazing places like Afghanistan, India, and Iran. This weekend, she'll be joining us from Northern Pakistan, where she's currently motorbiking through the mountains!

Here's her introduction:

---

&gt; Hey y'all! I'm Alex, a 28-year-old American solo female traveler and the creative brain behind [Lost With Purpose travel blog](https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/).

&gt; For the last three-ish years I've been backpacking full time, often roaming through countries people warned me to be well wary of such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. People often think I'm either A) crazy or B) a member of ISIS but I assure you only A is true.

&gt; In the last three years I traveled through: Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The whole world calls to me, but I have a special place in my heart (and passport) for South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan where together I've spent more than a year and a half in total.

&gt; During the last few years I've scaled ancient fortresses, seen gods dance, and road tripped across deserts. Overland travel is my MO; I've taken every kind of public transport under the sun from camping on floors of ferries to hitching rides with army convoys. While traveling I've gone through a breakup, lost family and friends, and fell in love when I least wanted it. I've eaten a million different kinds of street food by now, and had about as many bouts of diarrhea (I find it strangely satisfying at this point). I braved gynecological adventures in patriarchal India, and was saved from a foul and watery doom in a clinic in Afghanistan. Just last year I learned to motorbike in the chaotic traffic of Pakistan, and worked as a photographer for an organization helping refugees in Thailand. Let's just say I've been around the block.

&gt; At this point, I love to share about my travels in the hopes of inspiring and helping others to travel, as well as smashing stereotypes about the countries I visit. Oh, and of course it's always fun to prove that girls can get to some crazy places in this world, too.

&gt; Get at me with your questions! No thought is too silly, no inquiry too freaky. I think.

---

We're taking questions at the main thread over [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/bnrcub/announcement_upcoming_ama_with_alex_from_lost/) for those who aren't sure they'll be able to make the AMA in real time.

We know people in both Milan and Barcelona that we plan on staying with. We plan on visiting places between and somewhat near these cities. 

Here is our plan so far:

7/10-11 Travel from West coast US to Manchester

7/12-13 London area

7/14-16 Arrive in Milan, stay with friend.

7/17-19 Mountains (Italy and Switzerland) 

7/20-21 Rome area

7/22-24 Travel to Barcelona, stay with friend.

7/25-26 Southern France, more of Spain, or Portugal?

7/27 Fly back to Manchester from where ever

7/28 Fly back home with a 4.5 hour layover in Atlanta

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these destinations aren't set in stone. The flights to and from Manchester have already been purchased, but nothing else has been finalized. We do want to do some camping, or at least hiking. Depending on where we decide to go we might rent a car, but may just fly to a couple place instead. Again, haven't decided much yet which is why I'm asking here.

We will have an 11 hour stop over in Milan. I would like to know if we will have time to go to the centre of Milan for lunch and to look around a bit. Has anybody else done this? Will we have time to leave the airport for some sightseeing? And does anybody know if we will be able to check in our luggage in the morning so we don’t have to bring it with us to the centre?

338,Travel Hacking - Air - Hotel - Cruise Savings Techniques,"# Travel Hacking - Air - Hotel - Cruise Best Savings Techniques

• Always book at least a month in advance. Longer is better.

• Always arrive and depart outside of the 9am to 5pm hours.

• Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the cheapest days to fly. Next best are Thursdays. Avoid flying Saturdays and Sundays if at all possible. Never fly on a Monday or Friday.

• Avoid flying anywhere near big holidays like Christmas or Thanksgiving (duh).

• After you buy your ticket, keep checking on that same ticket price with the same airline. If the cost of the ticket goes down, call the airline. They will give you a refund or a voucher.

• Always check alternate airports at your destination. (But make sure the cost of getting to your hotel from the alternate airport is worth the ticket savings.)

• Nonstop flights are usually more expensive. Consider a connecting flight instead to save money.

• Alternate routes on international flights are usually much less expensive (like LA to Shenzhen to Hong Kong instead of LA to Hong Kong)

• Look on sites like cheaptickets, travelocity, and priceline. Once you find a ticket, go to the airlines actual site and check the price again, often it's cheaper.

• If you want to rent a car, use established [Rent-A-Car](https://c87.travelpayouts.com/click?shmarker=224540&amp;promo_id=2001&amp;source_type=link&amp;type=click) companies to stay out of troubles.

• Become a clergyman and show your Clergy Identification Card. You will get huge discounts.

Once you find the ticket online, call the airline and ask them about any Special Discount Programs. If you don’t get any discounts, then tell them you're there to attend a meeting (like a convention). They will often discount you.

• Travel agents can often offer better deals than the airlines! Call one once you determine a ticket.

The key question to ask them is: “Do you have any discount tickets to go from x to y?”

• The best time book a ticket is around 6pm on a Tuesday, using the time zone where the company is located. This is when they update their new ticket prices.

• Check [WebFlyer](http://webflyer.com/) for specials before booking your ticket.

• Purchase international tickets from the country you're going to, not the country you're in. So buy a one-way ticket to Hong Kong from the US, then buy another one-way from HK to the US, but do it from an HK company.

• ""You can also apply this same concept to international connecting flights. Suppose you’re in the U.S. and you need to visit Singapore and Korea. You can save up to 75% off your tickets if you purchase your ticket out-of-the-country. Start off by purchasing a roundtrip ticket from U.S. to Singapore. While you are inside Singapore, purchase a roundtrip ticket to Korea. This option is usually much cheaper than purchasing both tickets within the U.S.""

• Winter is usually the cheapest time to fly internationally.

• A good place to get international tickets: [JetRadar](http://jetradar.com/?marker=224540)

• ALWAYS check your flight price ""with a hotel"" or ""with a car"", because often the flight can be CHEAPER by doing this.

• The earlier in the day you fly, the less likely delays will occur.

• Install DING for amazing deals on Southwest Airlines flights. Same with Fare Alert. Ding is better though.

• ""You can secretly find out what kind of offers Priceline has recently accepted? Follow the steps below:

1. Go to Priceline’s page.
2. Go to [BiddingForTravel](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/biddingfortravel/)
3. Check up on the threads at biddingfortravel for the recently accepted offers for your appropriate state or country to find out what offers have been recently accepted by Priceline.
4. Go back to Priceline and search for your airfare ticket, then submit the lowest offer you can, based on the information you’ve gathered on biddingfortravel""

• You can instantly rebid on Priceline if your bid is rejecting by changing your criteria, like adding another airport.

• You can also rebid on a different computer with a different credit card.

• You can get a 50% discount from a ""bereavement fare"" due to a death in a family if you're flying to attend a funeral.

• You will usually not get a deal by booking a ticket last minute. That's a myth.

• Learn the three letter code of the airport you're going to and always check that the code is on the tag they put on your bags when they check them. (If you check any bags)

It's rarely worth it to pay extra for first class if your flight is under 4 hours.

• If you ever travel from one US city to another US city to catch a flight out of the country, show the agent this, and they will refund your 8 percent federal tax on your ticket!

• The five airlines with the most frequent fatal accidents over the last 20 years are: Aeroflot (Russia), China Airlines (Taiwan), Turkish Airlines (Turkey), EgyptAir (Egypt), and CAAC (China). These airlines have tried hard to make this information unknown to the public.

• Getting an international student ID card gives you tons of discounts on all kinds of travel expenses. This is the website: [ISIC](http://www.isic.org/)

• Purchase a ticket, then use [YAPTA](http://www.yapta.com/). They will send you an email if your ticket becomes less. Then call the airline and complain that you could have gotten the ticket cheaper. And they will refund the difference back to you.

• When the airline offers you to ticket the next flight because they're over booked, say you're interested but it's not enough. Ask for free trip and/or free first class upgrades and/or 100's in cash. You might get it. The time this usually happens is 8am to 9pm and 5pm to 6pm, and on Sunday nights, and on holidays like Xmas and Thanksgiving.

• Then when you do this, if you need to stay at a hotel, go to a hotel near the airport, and tell them your flight was canceled. You will get a 50% off the rate! Tell them you want the ""Distressed Passenger Rate"".

• If going to Japan, buy a bundle of hot import car rims from Japan, and sell back here in the US. You will make $1000s in profit if you do it correctly.

• Use Yahoo answers to ask ""What is a item in &lt;the country you're going to&gt; that is cheap there but expensive in the US?""

Fly at odd times of the day, ideally late at night or noontime. Avoid flying on mornings or on Saturdays or Sundays

• Get to your flight early, and ask the attendant if there are any seats in the front not booked by anyone. If they aren't, they will move you.

• Always try to sit as close to the front of the plane as possible (more comfortable, and you get off first).

• Generally speaking, the best three places for hotel reservations are cheaptickets.com, travelocity, and priceline.

• Travelaxe is a fantastic app for getting cheap hotel rooms. Located here:

[http://travelaxe.en.softonic.com/](http://travelaxe.en.softonic.com/)

• Another great place to get cheap hotel rooms is [Hotel Look](http://search.hotellook.com/?marker=224540&amp;language=en) great deals on lastminute hotel deals.

• When you check into a hotel, always ask what bonuses you IMMEADATELY get if you join their loyalty upgrade. Often you can get a room upgrade or additional discounts.

• When you check in, always seriously complain about something about the room. ""Two beds? I wanted a single queen!"" If they make you settle, then say ""Well, if I do that for you, what will you do for me?""

• When you check in, put a 20 dollar bill under your credit card, make sure the guy can see it, and ask if there are any room upgrades available. If he gives you one, give him the card and the 20. If he doesn't, just give him the card.

• When booking a cruise, always ask about extra tax charges and if food will be included.

Book the cruise, then check back every few days as if you are booking a new cruise. If the price has gone down, complain, and they will refund you the difference.

• Unlike with airfare, travel agents can often book a better deal on cruises than you can.",Shoestring

352,Ukraine and Georgia Solo Travel Ideas,"Decided to go travelling for five weeks (37 days) in June and July on a whim! Decided on Ukraine and Georgia as I am fascinated by the culture, and it's far enough away from the UK to still get relatively cheap flights! Budget for whole trip is £800 (without flights). Looking at £10/day for food. Travelling on overnight trains to save some accommodation money and in Georgia I'll be hitchhiking! If anyone has been, please let me know potential places/things that I may miss out on my itinerary.

* Day 1: Vienna (don't know much about the city to be honest, but wanted to experience a new country before I headed out east! Spending less than 24 hours here before I go to Bratislava.
* Day 2: Bratislava - similar to Vienna, simply going here to experience a new country/city given its' proximity to Vienna.
* Day 3-5: Fly to Lviv from Bratislava. I've already been to Lviv earlier this year and really enjoyed it and there's only a few things I still want to see here. I missed out on the ""flame thrower coffee"" last time I was here, so I'm essentially going for this, and to revisit a few of the other awesome parts of this city (Rynok Square, High Castle Hill). Although, if anyone has any suggestions outside the city but not too far I am open.
* Day 5-9: Overnight train to Odessa. Never been here but always wanted to go as I've heard it's awesome in the summer. Looking to just chill out on the beach here to be honest. Any must-see things here?
* Day 10-12: Train to Chisinau - heard there is not much to do here tourist wise but it's close and I figured, why not? Just a couple of nights here and worst case, get to see another country (countries if you count Transnistria)!
* Day 12-16: Train back to Odessa then on to Kiev. Looking forward to Kiev, been here once for a course but didn't get to see the city. Here I want to go to the outdoor gym on the Hydropark island(?) and Independence Square. I've heard the Chernobyl tour is quite good, but I'm not really interested in that to be honest, and it's slightly out of my budget.
* Day 17-20: Overnight train to Kharkiv. Not really sure about what to see here. Haven't heard much about it but I'm open to suggestions. 
* Day 21-24: Fly to Tbilisi. Spend a couple of nights here before I start my hitchhiking journey to Yerevan. 
* Day 24-26:Yerevan. You can probably see a theme here, not sure why I will go here but I will look at making a day trip to Lake Sevan and explore the city. 
* Day 27 - 30: Yerevan to Kutaisi. Probably a mixture of hitchhiking and public transport along the way. I know Kutaisi is a gateway to a number of attractions especially in the north. Is it worth heading up to Mestia? I've heard it's good and really want to go, but also heard there isn't much accommodation options and can thus get a little pricy.
* Day 30 - 34: Kutaisi to Batumi. Like Odessa, will be spending much of my time by the beach I hope! 
* Day 34-37: Overnight bus to Istanbul. Essentially have 1.5 days in Istanbul. Will look to see Taksim Square, Blue Mosque, and maybe some of the islands? I've heard it's absolutely huge in Istanbul so ideally it would be good if there are one or two sights close to eachother I can see! Then I fly home!

Looking forward to exploring seven countries (hopefully!). At the moment the only things set in stone are the flights and my first night in a hostel. So if you think I should stay longer in one place or shorter in another, I am completely open! Let me know your tips and thoughts. My first time traveling solo and I absolutely can't wait. Also, if anyone has any tips on hitchhiking, I'd appreciate it as I also haven't done that before.

Thanks in advance!

It just seems these days that 90% of them start with a trite "" Hiiii guys, we've just got to the hotel and we can now tell you we're in Hanoiiiiii/Bankok/Indiaaaaaaa"" Cut to next morning and intersperse giggling nonsense and cringe-inducing displays of a lack of research/knowledge/understanding of either the location or its culture(s) with drone shots and slo-mo sequences of the vlogger, vlogger's girlfriend or local walking through a market set to cheesy ambient house. At this point these polished, semi-pro looking tv programmes are very little to do with the travel and the location and pretty well everything to do with the ego of and the appearance of the vlogger. Which is fine, but just don't pretend to be about to show me the bazaars of Old Delhi or the Pyramids when in reality you're showcasing the clothes you've just bought &amp; how great you look in them. And then endorse the airline/hotel group or shitty tour company that are financing you to pretend you're not in it for money &amp; fame (which ain't coming any time soon with your 620 subscribers Karen) These McVlogs are then usually garnished with a *really* contrived thumbnail and uploaded side by side with a kajillion other identically saccharine 'coupley' clone travel vlogs. And while we're on the subject of thumbnails... I'm not gonna name &amp; shame because I'm just a salty, cynical old bastard having a rant &amp; theyve a perfect right to do wtf they want... But. There's two particular couples who have pretty popular channels &amp; are shoestring(ish) backpacker(ish) youtubers and in the vast majority of their respective thumbnails both women are doing this gimpy, village idiot, *Deliverance*-esque open mouthed grin. Irritates the living shit out of me and I can't work out out which channel's copying which. 

And that, ladies &amp; gentlemen, is what grinds my gears today. 

I should note that this is in no way intended to denigrate the tons of really good vloggers on YouTube who clearly love travelling and really enjoy &amp; do a good job of imparting the feel of where they are. Mostly by keeping the camera pointed at what they're looking at &amp; not crapping on about how great they are. 

This standardisation of many clone vlogs and the message it delivers has become lazy, egotistical &amp; shallow.

5. What about staying connected via mobile phone? I thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and pay my phone bill a few months in advance. I am hoping Metro PCS works well nationwide.

6. Does anyone have experience living out of their car? Any advice or recommendation regarding such would just be icing on the cake!

371,Best time to purchase LAX/NYC roundtrip for early June on Alaska Airlines?,"I need to use my companion fare bonus for Alaska Airlines by early June and wanted to take a trip with my wife from Los Angeles to NYC. 

Outbound flights aren't bad but the return ticket, which needs to be on a Sunday (June 9) are currently running ~250/per person. I don't have long term ticket price tracking to know if this is much higher or lower than it has been in recent weeks but I'm wondering what the odds are that prices will drop much lower over the next several weeks?

I am new to this, so let me introduce myself. 24 year old masters grad, who has found nothing gainful nor meaningful living in a small town of just over 9,500 people in Nova Scotia. Whether it be my lust to explore the world beyond me, the culmination of small town depression or a bit of both, little satisfaction has come my way since being away for the past 7 years studying and seeing the beauty of this planet. Alas, I am planning on making a journey to Texas from Nova Scotia to visit a friend. I am planning on making this journey by car, not with my own, but with the company of others. My question is thus, has anyone ever embarked on a journey with no money, only with the sheer will to move forward, and to carve your own path as your adventure moves forward.

I realize the problem is in how I spend my time and money when I arrive at my destination: rental car, ""decent"" hotel, tourist trap venues. For example, a trip to Phoenix for a Reds Spring Training game with my youngest son was easily over $600 for two nights. 
My boys are old enough to stay home on their own for a few days, and my comfort needs are somewhat lower when I travel alone. Backpacking, camping, and rock climbing are all among my interests and within my skill set, but I like cities as well.

431,"Best way to spend like $2,500 on a trip within the US?","I've been thinking about going to Lightning in a Bottle, but I'm not sure if it's worth the cost. I have a few different friends going but instead of camping with them I'll probably get a private tent.  That way I can meet up with different groups when I feel like it depending on what they're up to.

Then I was thinking about what else I could do with that money instead. I'm not really sure if Festivals like that are my scene, a lot of the talks are blatantly anti-science and I just can't put up with people like that (chakras, energy healing, ""cleanses"", star numbers or whatever, etc. I honestly can't believe how many people still believe in that crap, but I digress...). 

Instead, I've thought of a few options:

* going surfing in Hawaii or Costa Rica for the week.

* Buying kitesurfing gear and getting lessons somewhere (like Florida) because that's a hobby that I can get into and use for years.

* Spend a weekend in NYC meeting up with friends

Has anyone here been to Lightning in a Bottle, and if so is it worth it?

433,missing a connection - not an accident,"I am planning to fly one way from ORD-&gt;BRU this summer. When I looked at direct flights they were coming in at over $800. HOWEVER, that same flight with the same airline was only $250 total if I were to book the flight as ORD-&gt;BRU-&gt;LHR. Therefore, I could save over $500 by just missing the last portion of the flight. I won't have any checked bags and will not be flying back with that airline.

I have heard of the whole ""hidden city ticketing"" before. I've never done it and do not plan to do it much, if ever again. That amount of money would be substantial for me to save. That being said, should i be worried about ramifications of missing the connection? Will I run into troubles at customs in Belgium as I am exiting the airport or planning to leave the country?

I've been stuck in education system up until this point with Uni applications and everything and it has only just occurred to me that now is the first time in my life I could truly go traveling. 
What do you think about traveling before University? Is it a good idea or is it better to wait until after? Ideally I'd like to do it before, during and after. 
I'm also trying to decide whether to go it alone or try and bring a friend. I like the idea of travelling with someone, but I doubt this would be a possibility within my current friendship group. A lot of them think it is a waste of time, which is the polar opposite to how I feel. 
I'd really like to go to South East Asia. Places like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and anywhere else. Any suggestions on other areas in the region? 
I'm also trying to get into photography so I can take all the awesome pictures and maybe start up a travel Instagram or maybe even Vlog the trip on travel YouTube channel? Do you think that's a good idea? I feel as though there are a lot of young people in my position who could benefit from seeing someone try and take in the challenge of travelling. I also feel that this would be a good way to make money whilst travelling to sustain the trip. How else can you make money while travelling, with at least enough to survive on and keep the trip going? Can it even become profitable?

482,Best Way to Plan a Trip?? What's your method?,"My trip planning starts with Scott's cheap flights when they send me an email about a deal. Then, I find if the deal is available on Google flights for my city and buy the ticket if it aligns with my work schedule. Here is where the real planning starts...

I'll generate a new Google Sheet doc to collect all the info and create a rough itinerary (each column is a day of the trip and I'll write down important events like flights and checkin locations and things to do, places to eat, etc).

This works because I've been going on 8-9 day trips lately so the itinerary doesn't get too big. I'll first check for hostels or Airbnbs and if the price is right, I'll book it and then put it in the google doc. Then, I'll look for things to do on reddit, blogs, TripAdvisor, etc. If they need booking, I'll book them. I might ask for recommendations from friends as well if they've previously been to the location.

After I have an idea of what I want to do, I'll try to find some info on how to get to certain places usually from various blogs and sometimes from TripAdvisor and reddit and I'll either link them in the Google doc or jot it down as a note.

I'll estimate the cost or write down what I’m willing to spend and total everything up with all the known costs and that'll give me my total budget (roughly).

I might check the weather so that I can pack accordingly and check for the currency info as well.

I'll probably forget to check if I need a visa until I'm at the airport lol but this hasn't bit me yet.

I’ll centralize all the info I collected into the Google sheet itinerary which ends up being pretty useful on the trip and after the trip as well just to tally everything up.

Just wanted to share that and was wondering what your guys method was to plan a trip?? Are there any things you do differently? The same? Any apps to help me be more efficient?

487,Singapore of a shoestring,"Some older posts had links to blogs, but I thought I’d start a thread with some collective wisdom on enjoying this awesome city without going broke. 

ACCOMODATIONS: I found hostels on Agoba and also Booking.com. In the end I picked based on proximity to a subway line (Oh, how I love Singapore’s subway!!) but here are 3 spots friends or I enjoyed for less than $20/night. Look for places with breakfast (toast, coffee, tea). Also, it seemed that booking online actually got you a lower rate than booking extra nights at the front desk, FYI.

*Happy Snail Hostel* fun place to meet other solo travelers. 

*Vintage Inn Boutique Capsule Little India* was very affordable and very near the subway. Had laundry onsite and quiet location. No hot water, fyi. 

*Bunc Hostel* great vibe and lots of diverse travelers, as well as 24-hour reception (good for late arrivals/early departures) and good, budget travel ideas.

TRANSPORTATION: get an MRT card when you first arrive and enjoy what is possibly the best-smalled and most well-signaged train system in the world. Holy heck, do they make it easy!

Also Grab app for cabs is great for getting to the airport or the few places public transit doesn’t reach. 

TO DO FOR FREE:
Taken straight from Bunc hostel’s wall of suggestions:


1. Visit the Merlion 

2. East Coast Park. Water activities available, eat yummy local food at Lagoon Food Center.

3. Temple Hopping: Chinatown-Buddha Tooth Relic and Sri Moriommom (sp?); Kampong Glam-Sultan Mosque; Little India-Sri Veeramakaliamman. DRESS APPROPRIATELY, cover your knees and shoulders. 

4. Tree top walk: MacRitchie Reservoir Park-climb above the raiforest canopy in this park in the middle of the city.

5. Singapore River: walk 3.2 km from Raffles Place up to Clarke Quay (or the other direction) from shophouses to skyscrapers.  

TO DO FOR NOT TOO MUCH: 
Top of the *Marina Bay Sands*: buy a $22 food/beverage voucher to Ce La Vi restaurant on tower 3 and look out the Sky Observation Deck at the top (the deck pass is $23 and does not include food). 

*Gardens by the Bay*-if you skip the suspended walkway, you still see amazing gardens. 

*Botanic Gardens*: also lovely, although 

*Fort Canning* is similarly educational for free. 

*Cable Cars* vs. *Singapore Flyer*. Being able to explore Sentosa Island beaches and get to see the city from above might make the cable cars a better choice for you than the Singapore Flyer. A ticket for all three sections of cable car was $35 as of March, 2019). 

EATING: Hawker Centers are awesome. Shopping malls are often cheap and yummy, too. Maybe others can chime in below with favorites? Note: bring your own napkins!

492,"If you have access to a kitchen, here's a 7-day meal plan that's extra budget-friendly ($5/day)","I wrote this initially to share on my Twitter for any of my followers interested, but I feel like it also fits well here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Healthy Dishes for $5 a Day, With Tex-Mex Dinners**

$5 a day is only $35 a week. Is it possible?

If you’re starting with an empty pantry, then purchasing all of the items may come over $35. That’s okay. Some of the ingredients will last longer than this weeks meals. However, each days meals will not exceed the $5 budget.

And it can be even less than that if you utilize smart shopping techniques. You know, like buying in bulk and taking advantage of deals.

**Grocery List**

* 450g chicken
* 500g ground beef
* 150g canned tuna
* 150g lentils
* 3 bell peppers (2 can be substituted, options within recipe)
* 2 cans black beans (cut the price by soaking dry beans)
* 2 cans crushed tomatoes
* 1 head of lettuce (or other leafy green)
* 1 cucumber
* 2 avocados
* 3 large white onions (or yellow)
* 2 carrots
* 6 tortillas
* 1 jar of salsa
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 chicken boullion cube
* 350g oatmeal
* 4 bananas
* 12 eggs
* 60g rice

Seasonings and condiments aren’t listed, as most people have the basics on hand.

Also, I know avocado may not be the most affordable if you live in northern countries. None of these meals will be based solely around avocado, so you can easily substitute it for mashed peas or omit it.

**Breakfast (all 7 days)**

Banana Cinnamon Oatmeal

This is going to be the most boring part of the day, but hey, we’re on a budget! Go ahead and cook all your oatmeal, with two bananas sliced into smaller pieces. Add cinnamon and sugar to your liking. You can then split this into 7 portions, throw them in the freezer, and you’re done! All you have to do is microwave each one for about 1-2 minutes each morning.

**Lunch (days 1-4)**

Lentil Soup

To make this soup, first dice up an onion, 1 garlic clove, and 2 carrots. In a large saucepan, add a little oil and cook these veggies until soft. Pour in 3 cups (700mL) of water and 150g of lentils, and let this simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes. Next, add the bouillon cube and stir until it dissolves. Then, add 1 can of crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. I like thyme and basil! Let this mixture simmer for about another 10 minutes.

Divvy this up into four meals, and then you have an easy lunch to grab over the next few days. You can also pair this with a baguette for an extra delight.

**Lunch (days 4-7)**

Tuna Salad

First off, if you are not a fan of tuna, you can swap this for chicken! Now that your protein is decided, go ahead and hard-boil 2 eggs. When that’s done, peel and dice the eggs. In a large bowl, add 150g of tuna, very small diced pieces of 1 bell pepper, and the diced eggs. The bell pepper can also be switched for celery - maybe it’s cheaper. Mix it all up with a couple tablespoons of mustard (my preference, you can choose mayo instead) and add salt and pepper to your liking.

Add this mixture on top of a bed of lettuce, cucumber slices, or bread for a quick protein-packed lunch.

**Dinner (days 1-3)**

Chicken Tacos

Each dinner will need 150g of chicken, 1/3 a can of black beans, handful of diced cucumber, 1/3 of an onion, half an avocado (or peas), lettuce, salsa, and 2 tortillas.

Dice the chicken and cook it over medium-high heat with onions (either diced or in strips). Add salt and pepper. If you have chili powder, cumin, paprika, and/or garlic powder, add those too!

While this is cooking, you can rinse the black beans and heat them (microwave or on the stove). Also, take this time to chop some lettuce and mash the avocado. Spice up the avocado by adding some seasonings, if you’d like.

When the chicken is finished cooking, transfer it to a bowl, wipe the pan clean, and heat the tortillas (about 30 seconds on each side).

Finally, assemble your tacos with all the ingredients, with choosing to either eat the beans on the side or in the taco.

**Dinner (day 4)**

Stuffed Bell Peppers

You will need 100g of ground beef, 1/3 a can of black beans, 100g of salsa, 1 bell pepper (you can substitute this for eggplant, zucchini, etc.), 60g of rice, and half an avocado.

Start with cutting the bell pepper in half, coring out the seeds, and then baking it at 180 celsius (350 fahrenheit) for about 10 minutes.

While this is baking, get started on cooking the rice. Simply add your rice and double the water to a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once it’s at a boil, bring the temperature down to low and allow it to cook until all the water is absorbed. Then, remove from the heat.

While the rice is cooking, in a pan over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef. Season it how you’d like, but I recommend salt, pepper, chili powder, and cumin. Once the meat is cooked through, add rinsed black beans, salsa, and the rice (unless you want to eat it on the side).

Take the bell peppers out of the oven, and stuff each side with the meat mixture. Continue baking this until the peppers are soft.

Serve with mashed avocado on top and rice on the side, if you omitted it from the mixture.

**Dinner (days 5-7)**

Chunky Chili

Chili was actually my first ‘adult’ meal I ever learned to cook because it was so simple, yet packed with so much flavor. All you have to do is brown 400g of ground beef over medium-heat, then in a large saucepan combine the meat and all of the other ingredients. This includes 1 diced onion, 1 diced bell pepper, 2/3 of a can of black beans (drained), 1 can crushed tomatoes, and 1 clove minced garlic. To that mixture, add salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. A true pot of chili contains chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, and cayenne pepper.

In addition to that, I personally would add Tabasco sauce for an extra kick and some cinnamon.

Mix it up real good, let it boil for a couple minutes, then simmer it on low for about 30 minutes to get all the flavors out. Serve this as-is, or if your budget allows, some grated cheese and crackers.

**Snacks**

What’s leftover from the grocery list is 2 bananas and 10 eggs. That’s enough for 7 days. 1 banana or 2 eggs is a nice little snack to eat whenever you need. I like to eat a banana or hard-boiled eggs a couple hours after dinner.

If you do follow this meal plan, or even try one recipe from it, please let me know your thoughts! And if this is something you want to receive every week, I'm still toying with the idea of creating more based around spending $5 a day - if I notice lots of people are interested, I for sure will create many more. [Let me know if you're interested here](https://www.budgetmealplanner.com/). Was even thinking of some extreme ones like a 7-day meal plan based around only having a water boiler!

When I asked for a price breakdown or where these fees were coming from, the supervisor just responded ""They are taxes"". When I asked who was taxing me, since taxes were already accounted for, she changed it to ""Spirit charges an in-person booking fee""

So does spirit now have a new in-person booking fee? What's the deal?

Edit: After talking to Spirit on the phone and making a small fuss, I was able to get them to show me a breakdown of the price on there system. By booking at the airport, they add a bunch of fees as well as a ""fuel charge"" that is apparently ""voided"" when you buy online.

The SO and I are currently in the midst of planning our backpacking trip.

We will be flying from Taipei into Auckland (hopefully) on the 13th of October and staying for a month.

As we are a couple we would prefer private rooms as opposed to mixed dorms as that is the plan for SE Asia.

However, I keep seeing mixed reports on how expensive 1 month will be. Do you have tips on keeping the costs down?

We are unsure weather to go with a buss pass (kiwi exp or something similar) or just use inter city buses to get around.

Ideally we would love to hire a camper but that will just be too expensive.

Our budget is around $13,500.00 each but that's including all of SE Asia and $5000.00 will be needed to get into Aus with our working visa

544,12 Days in Philippines. 5 Must-Do's?,"Hey Frans,

My girlfriend and I have 12 non-flight/travel days in the Philippines March 23rd-April 6. We fly into and out of Cebu. My feeling is with such limited time, we should stick to 5 or 6 places max.

We're somewhat flexible with our budget, not at all opposed to staying in hostels majority of the trip, but would absolutely love a day or 2 of pampering in a resort, or somewhere we can lay in beach loungers with pina coladas without tons of people. The rest of the time, **we'd like to be diving or doing anything outdoors and adventurous. Would love to stay away from super touristy sites/towns**, but realize it's going to take longer to get to more remote places, and we have limited time.

**What are 5 must see places or must do's while in the Philippines for 12 days? We fly into and out of Cebu, so any itinerary suggestions that start and end in Cebu would be much appreciated!**

Thank You!!

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who gave us suggestions! The trip was a success! Time to return the favor for anyone that hasn't been yet. Here are some trip notes for the places we went within the Philippines:

Philippines Cebu •Boljoon •Hostel: Noordzee - stay in the beach tent. It is more like an A-frame cabin. They have bomb food both American and Filipino. Recommend mango shakes and fresh fruit mojitos. Seaside massages in their “spa” that is more like two rooms overlooking the ocean. Beach bar and hammocks. Great staff and friendly guests when we’re there. Be careful of belongings because anyone can walk through the beach and a couple of people had belongings stolen in lockers.

•Activities: you can see the whale sharks in Oslob but we didn’t do it because they feed them year long to keep them there for tourists. We did the Canyoneering instead and had a phenomenal guide named Wilson. If you book through Noordzee then you will get paired with Roy’s company where Wilson works. Transportation and guides will be set up by the front desk.

•Moalboal •Notes: was really not feeling this place because it was super busy and people were a little more aggressive with trying to give you rides and sell you things. We ended up staying one day only. • Hostel: Chief Mao - ended up not staying here but they have a lot of hammocks, good food, centrally locates •Activities: Sardine Run can dive or snorkel. This was actually really dope. It's spectacular to be diving and in the MIDDLE of 7 million Sardines, not just seeing from above. Definitely dive it if you have your certification. It's only $20 to dive.

•Mactan/Cebu City- ended up staying at the Waterfront Hotel in Mactan for three nights (not consecutively). It is right across from the airport (walk) and they have a great breakfast buffet. It's a bit pricey so negotiate, but it's an extremely convenient location.

•Busuanga Island/Coron Town

•Hotel: Charms Hotel - decent breakfast. Great pool and air conditioned rooms. Hot water isn’t great for showers. 15 minute walk from center of the town. Maybe would have enjoyed Hotel Del Mar more, but they had limited availability when we were there.

•Activities: •WW2 Ship Wreck Diving. Recommend diving with Amphibi-Ko

•Island Hopping tour Or Coron Island Tour. There are several tour groups that will take you. We used Laugh Trip and Millennial. For the price, these are definitely worth the while. You can go private, but unless you have like 7 friends, it's crazy expensive.

•Rent a Scooter for the day and drive around the island. This was one of my favorite days. So so nice to get some fresh air, away from all the hustle and bustle, and get to see the lush countryside. We got our scooter for like $20 for 12 hours. We used Angel Motorcycle Rental. We were very happy with them. The other places had terrible reviews.

Several people said the El Nido tours were worthwhile but we didn't have time.

I'm planning on making a trip to Italy with my girlfriend in August. It's my first time travelling ""alone"", tho she has already visited Barcelona and Belgium. We're planning things ahead (flights / hotels / what to see / where to eat) so we can have a general idea about the costs / time we need to spare:

Our first plan was to visit Cagliari. We were amazed by the views and everything around the city. We also got interested in visiting the french island, north of Sardinia. We didn't really check any prices besides the flights (which cost around 60€ total for each person) so we're kinda lost on this.

However, we got **really** interested in making a 3 city-trip around Italy. Starting on Milan, travelling to Florence and ending up in Venice. Flight costs are pretty much the same as going to Cagliari (around 60€ total each person) but we kinda got lost when choosing an hotel + public transport to travel in between each city. From what we've seen, we can find Hotels for \~40€ (2 persons) each night around the cities but we have no clue if the train tickets (Milan -&gt; Florence / Florence -&gt; Venice / Venice -&gt; Milan) or the museums tickets are expensive or not.

Also, we took into account food and such. We plan on buying groceries and things to eat on-the-go but we also want to try out simple and economic restaurants if there's any.

Our budget is around 300€-400€ (each) and we plan on staying 6 days (5 nights) in Italy. Is it possible? Is our budget to strict? Are there any better options out there besides Italy / these cities?

Should I look for a homestay? Airbnb? Hotel? I’d like to be more embedded in the local culture. For my research I’ll need ideally a desk and internet and a place to store my laptop securely, but maybe this can all happen at cafes. Other than that I am not too picky about accommodations.

583,Canary Islands Surfing Trip Suggestions,"Hi guys,

A friend and I are playing with the idea of going to the Canary Islands. Some years ago we tried out surfing and whilst we weren't pros in the end, we had a hell of a time. Coming from Europe we were looking for destinations that are more or less near by and could provide good weather in April (and of course cheap flights). In the end we're not looking for the best waves but a place with chilled and young vibes. We are probably going to rent a car so traveling around on the island wouldn't be an issue. If some of you guys had insider tips on the Islands that would be awesome. Which island would you suggest? Some of them seemed a bit dry and rocky whilst others were green and had endless beaches.   
Any suggestions are much appreciated

585,"My corporate banking job is soul-sucking. I look forward to my next flight and holidays. I decided to take create a travel deal blog to enable more people to travel, shitty long-haul carriers not included","I am a late twenties person, working on my third corporate job. At present, it feels like my management wants to create plenty of ""good-to-haves"" and stuff - reports, tools that may be beneficial to someone at some point in the future, yet does not have any real impact on the business.  Thus, my work seems not fulfilling - I feel like I am not helping anyone step up their game or improve their knowledge and understanding of a certain subject. Yet my life, I feel, is decent  - I can afford travelling several times per year and it works magic for me in terms of learning and appreciating the things I have. However, life is not so rosy for those living around me. In my post-communist country, everyday I hear plenty of grumpy people with narrow-sighted fears and beliefs, seemingly living pretty decent lives, yet unhappy about most things. Part of this, of course, is the backwards system some of the used to live in. And, I feel, a big part of that unhappiness stems from being ignorant to other opinions, cultures and lifestyles, probably stemming from times when ordinary people were not allowed to travel. Why? This was essentially done to portray the communist world as the perfect one, thus taking away the opportunity from my parents and their generation to see the beautiful world around us, corrupting some of them from the inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided I want to chip in somehow, to try and enable more people, both my fellow countrymen and others, to see more of the world and at an affordable cost. How? I am writing a simple blog, where I post cheap flight deals, both short and long-haul. I am looking to find the best, inexpensive options providing the best price/comfort combination to fabulous destinations, and not some crap random places.

I will post plenty of Ryanair and EasyJet stuff - after all, their flight deals are hard to reject. But for long-haul, I will never recommend flying on some obscure poorly rated airline - I will rather spend much more time to find economy class seats on the best airlines available. People only assume that good airlines are expensive - there's always a cheap flight deal somewhere, and I am here to help them out.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to show people that there is so much to see and appreciate once we experience the world around us. There's always color in life and those, that are not restricted by some unfortunate mental or physical capacity, should have the opportunity to see it.

I also enjoy seeing live music, no particular preference In genre necessarily. 

Although I love museums so much it hurts my cold dead heart, I’m also a fan of unstructured days to wander about interesting neighborhoods or markets.

I have been set on continuing on to different countries but my boyfriend suggested a road trip so we decided to choose the west coast! I believe we will be traveling from Chicago at that time and we have about two weeks for the trip.

We will be renting a reasonable car and bringing camping equipment consisting of a basic walmart tent for four my sister gave me and plan on bringing a lot of snacks and ""camp"" style food. We will likely stay in a few hotels or airbnb's along the way as neither of us are experienced campers so tips on that would be good! I am also kind of scared to camp in the desert, should I be worried?

We both love adventure (he is a bit physically limited but is down for the ride) and we also like unique experiences. We both smoke marijuanna but neither of us drink so we arent worried about wineries and such. He enjoys people watching (the crazier the better), food and animals and I really love pushing my limits (skydiving, rafting, cliff jumping). 

I am a huge hippie at part so it is important to me to get a little spiritual on this trip. I am very interested in the energy vortexes in Arizona, Sedona specifically and I've been told to check out Mt.Shasta as well but I don't know much about the spiritual part! I would also love anything with caves or digging for gems. 

With our interests and time in mind, do you think we would be better off veering to northern California or staying in the southern parts? There is so much we could do! Neither of us is super interested in tourist trap areas (walk of fame, ect) but if it can be worked in as a quick stop I know my SO will get a kick out of it.

Some of the places we talked about stopping in (no particular order): Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Tijuana, San Diego, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, Sedona, Colorado (not sure where but we want to go somewhere).

The issue I've been having, for instance, is, I tend to be a bit of a worrier - so - before I book my flights, I need to make sure that I have accommodation, as otherwise I get anxious. I know, looking on hostelworld should provide me with options (and yes, I know taht if I go to the hostel in person, I get the same offer for cheaper), but lately, I've also been having a blast with couchsurfing, as I've been enjoying the friendships and the fact that I can share my experiences with someone as well as that my budget can run me a little bit longer also, now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So thing is, this just happened (and it's not even the first time)... I was planning on visiting Berlin and nearby areas (prague, warsaw, and possibly more as I go), and I found some amazing deals. I saw a flight two-way for (E)50, and thought it was a catch - I considered buying it, and then hoping for the best, but something held me back. I spoke to some couchsurfers, sent out a bunch of requests, and then it took me over a week, for all the couchsurfers to confirm they could host me. (Most answered immediately, but one was a bit shaky), and thing is, by the time I knew I was ok, I went to book the flight, and realized it had tripled in cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course,  I set out to find some cheaper flights (I DID), and now i've spoken to my hosts, and hoping that they'll accept these alternative dates. But still, this leads to friction and issues. What do you suggest? 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I could just book a hostel, but unfortunately, I REALLY am on a SHOESTRING budget, and prefer to think of hostels as my last-minute emergency. I like hostels, but I was looking to make my money run a bit longer. What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I'm very grateful to couchsurfers who host me, in fact, I'm couchsurfing right now as I type this, I just arrived in Gozo last night to enjoy amazing carnival celebrations. I'm not annoyed at my host for delaying to answer and confirm,, of course. I know that family and issues easily get in the way and I am very grateful that somebody wants to open their home to me.

621,I think I'm in trouble,"My husband, son, and I are planning a trip to England this June (we live in the Eastern US). We had to wait longer than I like to buy the airline tickets because my son's passport took longer than expected to arrive. I found an awesome deal on an airbnb for the dates we were planning, so I booked it last week without plane tickets, thus locking us into precise dates. Tickets for our travel dates were totally affordable until today (I was going to buy them today!), when they suddenly jumped by $200 each. How likely is it that the prices will improve soon? Or are they more likely to get even more expensive? Should I just buy them even though we really of can't easily afford the extra $600? I know I made mistakes here, and I also realize this isn't really a ""shoestring"" trip, but I thought maybe someone here would be more knowledgeable about ticket price trends than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: Thank you, everyone. I followed a lot of the advice you gave and I  managed to get some tickets that are much closer to our budget. Thank  you all so much!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit again**: Here's what I did: I cleared the cache and history and used a private browser. Then I went to skiplagged, and right away I saw ticket prices that were more like $700 a piece, rather than $800. That saved me three hundred dollars from what I was looking at when I originally made this post. Some people had suggested trying different dates, and I did look into that, but the days immediately before and after the date we were planning on weren't any cheaper, and any further change in dates would be difficult due to our work vacation schedules. So I stuck with the original dates. Finally, someone recommended that I ask the airline over the phone if they gave discounts for children, and it turns out that Virgin Atlantic gives a 25% discount for seats for children under 11, so that saved us a further $175. So that's a total of $1925 for three round-trip tickets from Boston to London in late June, rather than the $2400 I was looking at when I made this post. So you all saved me $475!",Shoestring

On the other hand I expect it to drain my financial resources too fast if I stayed there for two weeks... so then a friend of mine proposed Denver and the Rocky mountains, where he has a friend who could also show me around a bit... also all of the hundreds of places I would like to see in the US came to mind, cities and nature and just too much to even see in a year. So now: for a low budget traveller who has 2 weeks time and has unfortunately never been to the US, what would you suggest that is plausible, i.e. 1. something thats not too expensive and 2. something that is not too expansive to explore during my meagre two weeks? I would love to hear some ideas &lt;3",Shoestring

My wife has her spring break in the middle of april so we were thinking of trying to take a long weekend away just to relax and reconnect a bit. Given how many expenses we have, we are trying to keep it relatively cheap but still looking for something fun to do. We are in the DC area (in between DCA and IAD) and are trying to keep costs under 500, not including travel (we can use points to fly if its relatively close by but are also down for road trips).

     During these trips we absolutely relish in the fun of “shoestring” style of travel, living on dollars a day, literally. 
   Last year we went to Colorado to hike a 14er (Blanca peak) we slept for a night in the sand dunes below and only showered in lakes and waterfalls. We summited the thing, and it was so much fun.

667,My Shoestring 2016 XC Road Trip Itinerary &amp; Breakdown,"TL;DR: Moved across the country and made a road trip out of it with two friends. Spent \~$300 per person. Here is my itinerary/cost breakdown.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reddit has become an invaluable resource in my travel planning and I wanted to contribute in some way. Hopefully someone can use it as a reference point in planning for other travels.

I had to move across the country after graduating college in 2016 and dragged my two roommates H and K along with me (e.g. we were all broke). We started in the Bay Area, picked K up from the airport along the way (she had a summer final to finish before joining us), and H&amp;K flew back to the Bay after reaching our destination.

This was our rough itinerary before we left, and I never got around to updating to include our last-minute changes on the road. I'm sure we could have done a lot of things better/others would have done things differently, but given our time crunch and preferences, this is what we came up with:

**Day 1 -- Friday, 8/12 || Las Vegas, Pick up K**

* **6:30am:** Drive to Las Vegas, eat lunch in car \[8 hours 12 minutes\]
* **3 pm:** Arrive, check into Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel
   * Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 12PM
* **Evening:** Relax, pool, nap, explore city, make dinner, prepare food for next day
* **9pm:** Pick up K and sleep
* **Food:** Eat fruit in car; eat late lunch in Las Vegas(?); cook dinner in hotel and enough to pack for next day! Fried rice.

**Day 2 -- Saturday, 8/13 || Hiking Zion Narrows**

* **5am:** Drive to Springdale, UT \[2 hour 37 minutes\]
* **8am:** Springdale to Zion shuttle
* **9am:** Zion to Narrows shuttle
* **10am:** Rental equipment
* **11am:** Narrows hike
* **4pm:** Shuttle and return rental gear
* **6pm:** Drive to Salina, UT (Rodeway Inn) \[2 hour 43 minutes\]
* **Estimated costs:** Park fee ($10/person), equipment rental ($27/person)
* **Food:** Fruit for breakfast; Granola bars and fruit for lunch; Fried rice and sausages for dinner?

\[\*Reddit notes: Hiking the Narrows was H's favorite part of the trip. I personally got tired of the Narrows after a while (everything started looking the same to me), but I loved Zion! Am planning to go back next month to hike Angel's Landing.\]

**Day 3 -- Sunday, 8/14 || Hiking in Colorado**

* **6am:** Drive to Trail Ridge Road and [Hiking Trailhead ](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Salina,+UT,+United+States/Moraine+Park+Discovery+Center,+Bear+Lake+Road,+Estes+Park,+CO/Glacier+Gorge+Junction+Trailhead,+Bear+Lake+Road,+Estes+Park,+CO/@40.2943515,-105.65846,14z/data=!4m20!4m19!1m5!1m1!1s0x874b761d82827acf:0x2a5286911d8c602d!2m2!1d-111.859925!2d38.9577407!1m5!1m1!1s0x87696537ea2f80e9:0xf5e7d250b180cafc!2m2!1d-105.5836374!2d40.3583199!1m5!1m1!1s0x87697b75421a3b6f:0x6ab5ddbdf0eca983!2m2!1d-105.6404437!2d40.3103053!3e0)\[8 hours\]
* **3pm:** Hike to Mills Lake (5 miles round trip)
* **\~8pm:** Check into Airbnb

\[\*Reddit notes: This quick hike in RMNP was personally my favorite part of the trip! We arrived before the sun started setting, but after the crowds. The altitude and scenery was amazing, and the hike was short/easy but rewarding\]

**Day 4 -- Monday 8/15 || Boulder, IHOP**

* **8am:** Explore Boulder
* **12:30pm:** Drive to Topeka, Kansas \[8 hour\]
* **10pm:** Arrive in Topeka and eat dinner, REST UP

**Day 5 -- Tuesday 8/16 || Chicago**

* **6:30am:** Leave for IHOP
* **8am:** (Global prayer room w/Jon Thurlow)
* **9:30am:** Drive to Chicago \[8 hour 20 minute\]
* **6pm:** Arrive in Chicago, eat dinner (Explore city)
   * Lou Malnati's Pizzeria, 805 South State Street, Chicago, IL 60605
* **8pm:** Leave Chicago for Ann Arbor \[3 hour 30 minutes\]
* **11:30pm:** Sleep in Ann Arbor with K’s frand

\[\*Reddit notes: Hiking the Narrows was H's favorite part of the trip. I personally got tired of the Narrows after a while (everything started looking the same to me), but I loved Zion! Am planning to go back next month to hike Angel's Landing.\]

**Day 6 -- Wednesday 8/17 || King Spa**

* 9am: Leave for King Spa
* 7pm: Eat dinner at King Spa
   * [KING SPA GROUPON](https://www.groupon.com/deals/king-spa-fitness-5-45) \[$26\]

**Day 7 -- Thursday 8/18 || NYC, Recovery Day in \[Mid-Atlantic Destination State\]**

\[\*Reddit notes: I believe we took a shuttle into NYC early, early in the morning and hung out a bit. I think this was K's favorite part of the trip! Her first time in NYC.\]

* **12pm:** leave for \[Mid-Atlantic Destination State\]
* **4pm:** arrive
* **6pm:** eat crabs!
* **8pm:** chill and die

**Day 8 -- Friday 8/19 ||** \[Mid-Atlantic Destination State\] **→ Airport**

* Late morning: Drive to Philly \[1 hour 4 minutes\]
* Early afternoon: Lunch, explore city
* Mid afternoon: Drive to PHL, goodbye H + K :(
* Estimated driving: 63 miles

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Food:**

* We had a $60 Costco gift card that we used to stock up on snacks and food (which we stored in our cooler) for the drives before leaving for the trip.
* One thing I was really excited about was engine-block cooking! We triple wrapped sausages in foil and stick it on the engine block, drive 30 min to an hour, take them out, and eat them as we continued on driving. Really perfect for after-hike snacks.
* The rice cooker was also great. We'd get frozen veggies and spam and mix it in with the rice and let it cook the night before/in the morning, and eat it later in the day. Or just make rice and eat it with our side dishes (we're Korean).
* The only times I remember eating out were in Boulder, Chicago, and New York (the cities we stopped in). All other meals (that I recall) were prepared by ourselves and eaten in the car while on the road. This definitely helped cut down on $$ and travel time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Money:**

* Gas: $203.43 (we tried filling up at Costco as much as possible, and I was driving a 2008 Hyundai Elantra)
* Sleeping accommodations: $376.88
   * We redeemed Airbnb referral codes for some reservations.
   * King Spa lets you stay overnight if you pay $12.50 more.
* Park fees/rentals/toll/parking/shuttle&amp;metro: $188.25
* Food (including Costco GC): $168.37
* Grand total (not including H&amp;K's flights back): $936.93Per person cost: $312.31

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Additional notes:**

* Thought that having 3 people was the perfect number for driving (one passed out in the back, one driving, one to keep the driver company). And for splitting costs. Four might have been too cramped in the car (since I was moving, the trunk was completely full with my belongings, and we were limited in space--but it's also just easier to sleep in the back when you have it to yourself!)
* We're millennials and don't carry much cash around... I completely forgot about tolls on the East Coast, and we were found scrounging around our car looking for enough money to pay the toll booths too many times than we should have.
* I'm planning another week-long trip to Utah (mostly) for this spring. Let me know if anyone's interested in that itinerary/how I can make any potential future posts more helpful!

672,Mexico City - the shoestring destination you didn't know about.,"Since this is r/Shoestring and most of the users here are probably from the USA I want to give a suggestion that few Americans seem to know about or consider..  


I know I didn’t..


Mexico City   (CDMX)


I first kept hearing about it here on Reddit and shrugged it off as “It’s Mexico”..  but it kept popping up in all different subs on how much people loved it..


So I went down the rabbit hole of research on here as well as a lot of Googling: Top 10 Mexico City/CDMX as well as YouTube..


It looked amazing, was incredibly cheap..  so decided to go.


My first trip was about two weeks and it was amazing, everything I thought it would be and more.. 


Usually a few days or so in a big city and you’ve kind of seen everything and I start to get a little bored.. but there was a lot more to do here than most cities..


Then another part of the Shoestring part:


About 6 months later I wanted to go somewhere for NYE..    I looked everywhere in the Caribbean and Central America and South America.. since it was the holidays, flights and accommodation were outrageous everywhere..  


I spent around $600 from what I remember correctly for 2.5 weeks.. this was for everything:  Flights, accommodation, transportation, food, entertainment etc.


Just the flight alone to somewhere like Cancun, Jamaica or Puerto Vallarta was more than my entire trip.


So we booked CDMX again.. this time it would be about a 2.5 week trip.


Cheap flights from the USA - we flew from Texas at $210 round trip


Amazing food:

Super cheap amazing street food 
OR
Very nice sit down meal and fine dining restaurants for $15+


Cheap accommodation - we did a private room in an AirBnB for $15 a night


Uber is like $2 for car pool for most of our rides


We basically walked or bicycled everywhere.. 

CDMX is one of the most bicycle friendly cities I’ve been in.. lots of bike lanes and the traffic is very aware and courteous.. and they have hundreds of kiosks where you enter in your code and off you go.. and then drop it off at another kiosk..  

Literally over 100+ of these in a very small area.. one on almost every block.


What to do:


The city has everything. 

Now I haven’t been there in over a year so I know I’m forgetting some main things but here are most of my favorites:


Historic cool old buildings and churches


Largest market in all of Latin America - La Merced (Go during the morning/daytime)


Tons of absolutely amazing parks - Chapultepec Park is the main one but there are dozens more.


Great city walk in with some really cool neighborhoods - Centro Historico, La Condesa, Polanco (rich area).


Great museums - don’t miss seeing the Aztec Sun Stone (Aztek Calendar) - it’s huge!


Bicycles!  - They also close down the main streets I believe Sunday morning so it’s a great ride though the city to see all the architecture and buildings


Lucha Libre - Mexican wrestling - Arena Mexico - I’ve always sat in the first or second row - they will literally fight in the stands right next to you - it’s like WWE on steroids - buy your tickets during the day from the actual box office.


Frida Kahlo House - the neighborhood and local market is nice too


Xhochimilco - boat rides through the rivers (Island of the Dolls is another option here) great for groups or a couple - some will have 20+ - it’s quiet during the week or a big party place on the weekends.. music, food, entertainment as you’re pushed along on a big bright colorful boat.  

Don’t forget to check out the Axolotls as I think this is the last place in the world where they exist.


Teotihuacan Pyramids - you can take the public bus from the north part of the city or hire a private car/bus.  Can’t miss.


A FEW OTHER SMALLER MUST SEES:


Sears Department Store coffee shop (tea and pastries as well) 8th floor - hidden gem - outdoor seating area with an amazing view of Palacio de Bellas Artes.


El Morro - legendary local place - 3-4+ locations - hot chocolate and churros - often an hour wait just to get a table


THE FOOD!   


Amazing food, amazing food, amazing food!  This can’t be said enough..  tacos tacos tacos


If you like Mexican food - you won’t want to leave.


I’m pretty well traveled at around 27 countries but this could very well be my favorite city I’ve ever been to..

How do you save up enough money to actually get to Europe from NA?

I am currently considering going for two months/60 days, and am able to live like a local (since I've done that already for a decent period of time). I know the cheaper places to drink, how to shop at Aldi/Tesco/Spar on a budget, and if my cousin can live off of 500 euro a month in salary I can live off of about as much.

Not sure what order to do things next. Always wanted to go to Greece to see ancient sites+nature. Having a hard time rationalizing putting the trip off for much longer.

\-budget: $5,000 USD including airfare and buffer. \[\~3,000 for 35 days backpacking/touristing\]

&amp;#x200B;

\-duration: long as budget+visa allows

&amp;#x200B;

\-departure:I'm thinking after peak season but am open to the idea of going before

\-destination: If I had all the money in the world I would go all over Greece.

\-Regions/places: at the top of my list is Crete (like, all of it) and making a visit to Mt. Parnassus/Delphi. And I guess I'll spend some time in Athens while going between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

\-activities/desires: Pretty much mountains/nature, archeological/ancient sites, and monasteries/churches. Would like to find  a work exchange/wwoof or two.  I love hiking/chilling in nature, being active, and i like to have some quiet time at the end of the day to stretch and read.  I like socializing but I tend to be too timid to break the ice.

In the states, our national parks are open to all and in general here there's much more of a culture of outdoors, backwoods camping and being in nature.

Needless to say, I didn't do almost any camping in SA. There were places basically like hostels that offered you facilities and conveniently illuminated spaces near cities where you could pay to ""camp"", but this to me defeats the entire purpose of camping, which is to have more intimate relationships with nature. To find true silence and peace and beauty.

Life-changing experience to say the least.

I want to do this again but on the East coast minus Florida (I've been here a ton of times and will go back at another time).

I am starting in Atlanta where I live where I will check out some civil rights history that I haven't seen after living here most of my life. I know what a shame. I've seen most everything else in Atlanta though.

Taking a Greyhound or train to DC to check out Smithsonian (again) and the Presidential Memorials (again). Open to explore a few other places but I did visit in 2006 and remember seeing Ford's Theater and Mount Vernon, so I'll skip these this time to save time and money.

Take a bus or train to Philadelphia for the first time. I know I have to check out the place where the Constitution was signed, some Ben Franklin history, also eat a really Philly cheesesteak for the first time. I don't eat a lot of meat but when I do, I want to get something authentic and memorable. Open to suggestions here for sure, not familiar at all.

Take a bus or train to NYC. Central Park. The Met. AMNH. Rockefeller Center, Top of the Rock, a VR show there called 'Spheres' (sounds amazing). Get a nice bagel/coffee to start the day, some sushi or something for lunch, some pizza for dinner. I want to see 9/11 Museum and Wall St too. I'm stuck here the most, how can I see NYC on a budget without needing to break it into another trip in the future? Is Couchsurfing or WorkAway a good idea here?

End the trip in Boston (been here before), so I don't have to see everything again. I have to check out the JFK Museum though, also Cambridge (I'm thinking about applying to Harvard's Extension School in the future). 

**Time** - I work remotely, so I am not worried about this. I am bringing work with me and can do a lot with just a few hours of sitting in a cafe or library.

715,How to save on your travels? [Tips and Tricks],"There are many things to consider when you're preparing for a trip. What to bring with you, where to book a room, where to exchange money etc. These things are essential no matter where you go, but if they are done correctly and with enough research, they can also save you a pretty penny which can then be spent to see an extra sight or experience more things. But how exactly can one save on their travels? Here are a few tips.

First of all, you need to find the best deal when it comes to booking your rooms. There are many big and famous booking websites out there, but the one making all the news lately is [LockTrip](https://beta.locktrip.com/?refId=42100). This is because this platform is using the latest technology to cut out middlemen who usually take a significant chunk of the money you use to pay for a room. [LockTrip](https://beta.locktrip.com/?refId=42100) uses the freemium model to finance itself, which is why the prices on their website can be up to 30% lower compared to the competition.

Next, you need to be careful when exchanging money if traveling abroad. Not all exchange offices offer the same prices, so it pays (literally) to inform yourself a little, especially if you're planning on using larger amounts of cash. Larger cities sometimes have notorious exchange places where you get significantly worse deals, and if you're not informed you can easily miss that. This is often the case if the country you're traveling to doesn't use dollars, euros or something like that but has its own unique currency.

It is also a good idea to check out transportation options in the city you're visiting. Some have very efficient public transport systems, but in others it may be a good idea to use taxis or even Uber or something similar. Always check if it's possible to purchase a daily (or even a weekly ticket, depending on how long you're staying) ticket if you plan on using public transport a lot because they usually get you a nice discount compared to buying tickets individually. 

There are plenty more things to consider when making your plans, and to really make the most of your travels visit [onedayitinerary.com](https://onedayitinerary.com). They have loads of useful tips on cities all over the world and will help you make the most of every second of your trip.

Taking into account that this price includes both hotel and direct flights I was really intrigued by the quality of the accommodation but surprisingly it was better than expected. We departed from Miami and our surprise destination was Austin (never been before but I'd heard some great things) and discovered such a cool city with a lot of things to do. The hotel was Hotel Indigo Austin, in downtown, and both flights were with American (first flight was early morning and the second was late afternoon, so it was long enough). The only thing I would ask to improve is the city guide that they send you (a lot of activities but too long and boring), I ended looking for some cool places on Pinterest. Definitely, very impressed for the quality-price ratio. Maybe I could have found something similar for approx the same price but the surprising factor is a temptation. I used [www.flynimbus.com](https://www.flynimbus.com) but I'm sure there are more companies doing this. I'm thinking about trying it again but this time in Europe.",Shoestring
720,Car rental for a month?,"Going to Alaska for a month. If I drive my car, it will cost about $400 in gas each way. Renting a car through an agency will cost at least $750. Is there a cheaper way to have access to a car for that long?",Shoestring

Travelling Canada by train this year.,"My boyfriend and I were both really lucky enough to be able to buy two train tickets from Via rail on Black Friday. Unlimited travel anywhere within Canada for about $360, after taxes for the months of June and July. We had been saving for a trip to Toronto so luckily we had enough for the tickets, plus a little extra to jumpstart our savings! I should start by saying, we’re from New Brunswick and we’ve spent every summer of our childhood exploring the east coast. There’s a slight issue, though. We’re moving into our first ever apartment this summer in Montreal, so in order to make this work, we need to be as frugal as possible. I wish I could give you a straight answer as to how many days this trip will take us. We’re trying to play it by ear and go at our own pace since we were careful enough to save enough money to take care of our apartment and not work until August. We’re planning on using Airbnb and buying groceries as opposed to eating out every night, and sway more towards natural and free attractions. We’re also going to try to only use a book bag each, and take public transportation. Now that the basic information is out of the way, I will list off the cities we’re hoping to hit. Starting in Ottawa, we’re going to go to Toronto, Niagara Falls, a ( Free lodging) stop in Windsor, Winnipeg, Edmonton, and lastly, Vancouver.

758,25M Canadian with 10-15k &amp; anxious about money looking for adventure itinerary advice,"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

Apologize for the long post. TLDR at the end.

Doing a long-term (\~12 months or more) trip has been a dream of mine for about a decade now. I'm at a point in my life now where the timing is right (finishing my master's degree, doesn't know what to do next except for a phd) and I've been saving for a bit now in anticipation of that dream-trip. I'm also at a point where I just want to go away as long as I can (or want to). I expect to have about 10k by may + another 5k in savings. Ideally, the 5k would remain untouched so I can keep some financial cushion for when I come back, but I expect to tap into it anyway down to perhaps 1k.

All that being said, I have trouble on deciding on an itinerary. To be clear, I don't want a precise route to follow (I like spontaneity), but I can't decide on my starting point + general direction. I'm looking for an off-the-beaten-track, high in adventure route. I don't mind more hardcore stuff; I even look after it (some will disapprove (ahem r/solotravel ahem); that's fine). Although I'm not a veteran backpacker, I have experience with Asia and Africa. Basically, my highest interests are, in no particular order : Iran, Pakistan, Mongolia, India, Nepal, SEA, crossing the Atlantic by sailboat, potentially Maghreb. Iran and Pakistan being the most complicated visa-wise (you'd think being Canadian would help, go figure), yet some of the most interesting places! Also, cost of travel there vary depending on sources, ranging from 20$/day to 60$/day, which is way too much for my budget.

I'm aware I can't possibly do all those in one trip without taking a longer break and with more money. I already bought a cheap flight to London, where I'll instantly hop on another flight whose destination I have yet to decide. That's where you guys come in.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential itineraries:

\- Starting in East-Europe because of cheap european flights. Going north to catch the transsiberian to Mongolia. Go south through China, then SEA and finally India/Nepal. That was my first thought, then I realized I could probably do better.

\- East-Europe start. Turkey. The three Caucasians. Iran. Pakistan. West China. Mongolia. East China. SEA. India/Nepal. (Then somehow make all the way back for Atlantic crossing?) I can hardly see how I could do all of this with 15k.

\- Start in SEA. Circle throught China/Mongolia/India/Nepal. Then either Pakistan/Iran/Turkey/Eastern Europe, or the transsiberian. Pros: I start where it's cheapest and logistically simpler; I basically start form the other side of the world and find my way back. Cons: Plane ticket is 10x more expensive; even more difficult to get visas for Central Asia

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts and advice? Am I being too ambitious? How long can I expect to travel with 15k, assuming I'm willing to hitchhike and camp where it's doable?  


TLDR: About 15k in savings for a long-term trip through ""Eurasia"". Dunno where to start and which direction I should take. Looking to travel for as long as I can, so cheaper options are best.

779,Spent about $500 on our trip to and from Toronto (stopped in Niagara Falls too!),"We drove from Wisconsin and stopped in various places along the way.

 

We kept it low cost by staying at cheap airbnbs. First one was in Buffalo close by Niagara falls. Just 25 a night for a private room, $12.50 split. The second was a whole apartment in downtown toronto for about $60 or $30 split. We also did a lot of free/low cost activities such as Toronto Island ($12 i think?), CN Tower (about $35 just to go the top), and ice skating downtown (around $10). We also tried cooking instead of eating out and did things like eating pb&amp;j's at 3:00 in the morning at a planet fitness opposed to stopping at a McDonalds. Unfortunately we got in an accident halfway home, but her insurance covered it all so in the end it costed me nothing. Got a cheaper car and actually pocketed some profit lol.

786,Using Qapital to Save for Travel,"TLDR: An app that helps you painlessly save money for travel, get $5 free

For the past two years, I've been using this app called Qapital to save money. It connects to your bank account and allows you to save money for specific goals like a trip that you want to take or a piece of gear that you want to buy. You can set what they call ""rules"" on how it saves. So for me, it saves $30 every time the New York Jets win (which isn't too often) and $1 every time that Donald Trump tweets (a lot more often). It's a great way to save money without feeling like you're saving money. If you sign up with someone's referral code, you get $5. The person who refers you gets $5 too. If you download it on your own, no money at all.  If it sounds like an app that interests you, I'll leave my link below. Let's spread some cash so we can all keep traveling.

**UPDATE** 
So I did call the airline just to talk through it with them and they did confirm some things:
- if you don't make the first leg of your trip, all other legs are canceled.
- if you miss any leg other than the first leg, the rest of your trip *may* be canceled (but probably won't be if you contact them in advance or have extenuating circumstances)
- the pricing and logistics of this trip in my situation ""doesn't make any sense""... seriously, the lady on the phone told me that.  She said I'd be better off financially to buy a one-way ticket CLT to EWR plus the round trip EWR to CLT to CDG!",Shoestring
791,Solo NZ (6 day) &amp; Aus (16 day) Road Trip - Mid-Sept,"Looking for feedback on my trip. Prioritizing time &amp; experience on this trip since I'll be solo and the priority locations are so spread out, especially in Aus. Not as shoestring as may be typical on this sub, but I'm doing my best to keep it cheap &amp; would love feedback on cutting even more.   


Flight summary: Multi-city, rough estimate:  
USA --&gt; Christchurch, NZ (6 days)  
Auckland, NZ --&gt; Sydney, Aus (16 days)  
Sydney, Aus --&gt; USA.   


**Part 1: New Zealand.** I wanted to do both islands but round-tripping it takes time &amp; $, as does standard one-way options. I found that by using [https://www.drivenow.com.au/onewayrentals.jspc#/relocations/NZ](https://www.drivenow.com.au/onewayrentals.jspc#/relocations/NZ) I can coordinate a vehicle in advance, which I can drive cross-country for $5/day, so my biggest expense will be gas. On top of nearly eliminating a car rental &amp; hotel/hostel costs, it opens up freedom to set my own schedule &amp; itinerary, and I can hit most of the places on my list, even staying in the rural areas instead of cities if I want. Total anticipated cost for 6 days in NZ: just shy of $500 ($380 is diesel). Highest priority travel stops: [https://goo.gl/maps/SyZtspQ1Ksz](https://goo.gl/maps/SyZtspQ1Ksz) \-- I welcome any input/suggestions!  


**Part 2: Australia.** I've been to Aus before and will return again, but this will likely be my only solo trip for a long time. As such, I'm setting a rather aggressive itinerary to see all the out-of-the-way stuff that interests me - 5800 miles in 10 travel days, with 5 days for rest, scheduled events, &amp; exploration. I'll be doing something similar as the system in NZ, but because of the distance I'll be using a passenger van that should improve my efficiency, even if it leaves me tight on space. I estimate $2000 in vehicle rental &amp; fuel, with probably another $400 in ""extras"", but will be able to save on lodging by camping in the back most nights. What I'm really keen on is making sure I hit as many highlights as I can on the route I've got. I'm linking my travel day itinerary below - if there are highlights anywhere near my route that I've not included, or ways you can think of to help cut my costs even further, please let me know!

794,Planning a trip around NW Europe (coming via Calais from the UK). Is it better to drive or to hope on trains/buses?,"Hi all!

My partner and I are planning a month-long visit this summer around North West Europe, we will either sail (in car) from Dover to Calais, or fly from London to somewhere in France. 

Our rough itinerary includes: Lille, Brussels, Antwerp, Amsterdam, then back down to Maastricht, Luxembourg, then back through France.

I am a keen driver and there is a max of 2 hours between each location. We would stop in each place for 2-3 days so I wouldn't be driving every day. However, my partner doesn't drive so it's just me, and I sometimes get stressed when trying to follow directions, especially on the other side of the road I am used to!

I know my car, it's 10 years old but a reliable Mercedes. I would budget around £20 a day for petrol (driving days only). It would allow us to come and go as we please, and stop anywhere we find interesting. However, trains would allow me to relax more (and drink!).

We snagged some tickets from Vancouver to NYC for Feb long weekend (get in 16th 6am - 18th 8pm). We get free accom with a family member (same age, good friends) who has an apartment somewhere on the Jersey side of the river facing Manhatten. It sounds like a pretty shwanky place. We are trying to take advantage of it whenever we can while his job has him posted there since he is on a working visa so you never know if the company will ship him somewhere else. 

We've always wanted to see New York in the snow, it looks so beautiful, and even if we don't get any snow (which at this stage doesn't seem too likely) it's just beautiful city in the cold (we've been in November for Macy's Thanksgiving, but it wasn't in the negatives). We love the cold.

We've been to NYC staying in lower Manhattan and upper west side a few times before. We've knocked out the standard tourist stuff like the site seeing booklet. We've done some weird stuff like Kenny Kramer tour. We've done a bunch of comedy clubs like Fat Black and underground (I keep forgetting if those are the same thing). We've hung out in the trendy Brooklyn bars and love Dumbo (the Pizza!!). We've walked over a lot of bridges. We've hung out on Coney Island for a day. We've discovered some small bars that seemed impossible the find (like accidentally finding a speak easy through the back of a barber shop? wtf?).

EDIT: Stayed in The Roosevelt. Walked all through central park, even watched an eclipse from the park. Liberty Island, Ellis Island. EDIT: Stayed Upper West Side fancy apartment. Broadway Musical (Aladdin).

When we go somewhere we make sure we have no lazy days so we've knocked over a lot of stuff.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on something we should try! I know you guys always find random things to do on the cheap. Any cool areas of Jersey to check out? Also best way to get from JFK to Jersey? Unfortunately JFK was the best timing on direct flights that didnt eat into either the weekend or work.

832,First time solo travel on the west coast.,"Hi r/shoestring, first time poster here. I'm M(24) based out of Atlanta and looking to take  my first solo trip in September for the Labor Day weekend (8/30 through 9/2). I have never been to the west coast so I my preference lies there. I am okay to save costs by staying in hostels, etc but open to spending the $ for a good experience. 

I would like to explore a major city and do a day long hike in a state/national park. The caveat is I am not that comfortable driving alone so it is kinda important that the city is pedestrian/bike/public transit friendly and the state park is accessible by public transit/Uber/bike. If it helps, I'm not big on the clubbing/nightlife thing but I do enjoy breweries and places with live music. This is just a nice-to-have.

Any suggestions with accommodation (this is the part I have little to no experience in) tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance and happy to provide more information.

856,Question: Keeping costs low in Se Asia / when to splurge,"Hi, 

I've been travelling China for the last month, and am travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand until near the end of August. After that, I am starting an exchange in Hong Kong. I have a decent amount of money saved for my exchange and subsequent travels, but I only budgeted around 3k for my three months in Se Asia. I've been pretty good about sticking to my budget for accom/food/transport, but I did have a few of unexpected expenses including needing to buy a new camera lens because my original one was damaged (300), I had to buy an exit flight before boarding the plane to China (200) and I had to pay to expedite my Vietnamese visa before I left (which I didn't even up needing because I flew into Hanoi instead of crossing overland as planned, so I could have gone with the cheaper visa on arrival!) 

Anyway, my problem is.. I want to stick to my budget as closely as possible, which means about 20/day ish for the remainder - but I don't want to give up too many activities. So, I was wondering if people had tips for living making the most out of a small budget. Like what activities are worth splurging on (like i just did a ha long bay cruise and it was def worth it) and what cheaper activities are often overlooked (like... treks in national parks? motorbiking around rice fields?) 

So far my favourite things so far on this trip have been walking the great wall, eating street food in shanghai, hiking zhangjiajie, ha long bay (and swimming with the bioluminescent plankton), and exploring cafes in hanoi... I def lean towards like outdoorsy activities; swimming, hiking and kayaking, but i love a bit of food tourism too. 

Specifically, what do you think of the following activities:

\- diving course: is it worth the cost and where is the best place to do it for the best experience.  (vietnam? thailand?) 

\- elephant sanctuary. I def wanna see some elepahnts, but i want it to be ethical! where was your best value for money experience. I'm considering mondulkiri project in cambodia or one of the most popular sanctuaries in thailand)

\- any other activities that you think are worth splurging on  (rock climbing, ziplining, massages?) 

\- similarly, what are places worth staying at with good free activities. i'm pretty keen on the idea of staying at a good beach (or other place with good free activities?) for a week or so and just swimming / exploring / eating pineapple, so my only expenses are accommodation and food. What are the best beaches for this in Vietnam/ Cambodia/ Thai Islands? 

If you have any other suggestions for keeping costs low without sacrificing experiences, let me know!

861,TIL an airplane is not like a bus,"So I booked a ticket from Chongqing --&gt; HongKong --&gt; JFK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having booked the ticket from Guangxi, I'd have to make my way to Chongqing to catch the flight. So I thought, I might as well just take the train to Hong Kong and catch the second flight from there. So I did. I thought I'd just walk up to the gate in HKIA and hop on the plane and nobody would care nor ask about my absence from the first flight. Well guess what? They did. 

&amp;#x200B;

So apparently it's the policy of *all airlines* that a booked ticket must be taken from the very first flight, or otherwise the rest of the trip will be automatically cancelled (it's in the small print at the end of the confirmation email). 

I'm taking full accountability here, and not posting here to bitch about the system (although, yes it would be nice if that were not the case). I just thought I'd share my experience here to prevent any naive individuals like myself from making the same mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're curious about the end of the story: after (regrettably) arguing with customer service of both the airline and Trip.com for around 30 minutes, I let it go, booked a new, cheaper, ticket from HK to JFK for later that day, accepted the partial refund for my first flight which amounted to around 40% of the ticket, and went on my way.

865,Just back from Stockholm not the cheapest place) some tips for doing it on a budget,"1. Investing in a public transport pass is a good move. It cost £23 for 72 hours which seems quite high but the network is massive. You can even get to the archipelago on it (an island called Vaxholm) Will add it doesn't include airport but flixbus is cheap for that.
2. Last point leads on to next one, don't stay in the Old Town/City Centre choose somewhere close to a Tunnelbanna then you can save money on lodgings, plus there are usually more interesting places in the less touristy areas. I personally stayed in Sodermalm right near Skanstull and would highly recommend. It was less than 10 mins to get to Gamla Stan from there
3. Try to stay somewhere with kitchen facilities, the supermarkets are good so you can save money by making picnics. Wilys and Lidl were the cheapest ones. I think on eating/drinking out the same advice applies anywhere in the world- its always going to be way more expensive in an ultra-touristy part of the city.
4. I found quite a few bars that were not very expensive (could get a 40cl beer for under £4 ) sadly most of them did not really have the atmosphere you'd want (not awful but not great) I would however recommend Carmen on Tjärhovsgatan (Sodermalm) totally no frills but in a good way, apparently its the 1 cheap place the young cool locals go

893,The bus ride from hell (Ourbus),"Good afternoon everyone, I apologize if this isn't the place to share this but since it involves me trying to travel cheaply I thought it best to give a warning. 

Today I hopped on a bus from Norfolk, VA to New York, NY with the ultimate destination being Boston, MA. Grand total? $37 USD before taxes. Score right? I booked my first bus to NY through Ourbus because they offered sokid amenities(A/C, Water, Wi-Fi and clean restroom. So I showed up and waited. The bus was maybe 5 minutes late so not to bad. I hope on and the first thing I notice is heat. Not just warm. But full pitstains hot. I try to adjust my AC vent to find that it's not blowing, it had broken. Oh well, we pop the roof vents and occasionally get some air. I ask for some water, they're out. Frustrating but I came prepared. I try to get on the Wi-Fi when we hit the rural areas. I'm sure you can guess what happened, no luck. Despite the losing 8 pounds in sweat I still have to utilize the facilities. I stepped in, backed out, and held it for 9 hours. At some point we get roughly a half hour behind. Then the driver decided to stop for a smoke break. . . for a half hour. So for a half hour we say on the oven of a bus so this guy could smoke. Ya know what. Oh well. I had an hour and 10 minute gap because I know stuff happens. Well apparently at this point he realizes we're late and begins driving very aggressively. Give you a nickel if you can guess what happens next. If you guessed he hit a car, you'd be correct. At this point I've missed my connecting bus by half an hour. And he spends another half hour fighting with this chick who was holding onto his phone until the police arrive when one of the other passengers just snatches his phone back and he leaves the scene of an accident. Goes maybe 300 yards and halfway up an exit to let passengers who are done with this off. Then crosses the double white lines back into the freeway. Another half hour and I'm finally at the stop. Now I needed to get to Boston tonight and I'll be demand if I'm getting on another bus. So I jog down to Penn station and spend $145.80 on a train ticket (that's with military discount) and pretty much just suck up the $10 loss on a Megabus ticket I didn't get to use. So I play phone tag with these guys, three calls, various IMs on their website and emails and it's not until I mention that the press should be made aware that they give me a whopping 27 dollars. . . of credit. After politely explaining that I'd rather walk from VA to NY on broken glass they said they'd look into it. Theoretically they'll get back to me by noon tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath. If there's interest I'll update this. Apologies for errors writing on mobile from a train.


TLDR: Ourbus is hands down the worst travel company on earth. I'd do anything to not have to deal with them again.

- Cost: I'd like a relatively affordable area
- Population: I don't mind seeing the countryside, but I'd like to spend time in some sort of relatively lively city, not just peace and quiet

921,What are some tips you have for saving money while doing the Pan American highway?,"Let me start off with saying, this trip is at best a couple years away, but I really enjoy the planning phases of a trip and I always love learning about new things I can use while traveling, so that’s why I’m asking so early. 

I am hoping to do the pan American highway in a Jeep Wrangler (probably a 2 door, not sure yet though) over 3 years (36 months) but if I can make my budget last I wouldn’t hesitate to stay longer and use up all of my budget on such a trip. The plan is to camp, cook my own meals when it makes sense and really not party to save money. I’m already not much into drinking and I’m not going to get involved in any sort of drugs. 

Ideally I would like to visit every country in the America’s except for Venezuela, so this includes Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. I’m really not sure what more information I can provide lol, I of course want to see all of the main attractions while I’m there but I also want to go get far away from the tourist circuit as well. 

Budget wise in my mind I’m hoping I could easily stick to 12k CAD (9k USD) per year. So far I have heard from two people that have done the pan American highway and one managed a budget of 27k USD for two years everything included (seems a bit high to me..) and another who did 3 years in 40k CAD, but he admits he splurged a few times each costing him hundreds/thousands (like his trip to Easter island, scuba diving courses I believe and Galápagos Islands) he said had he been a bit more budget conscious he thinks he could have easily done it on 12k CAD/year which is where I’m getting my estimates from primarily. 

I don’t think I’d be interested in working while there, but at the same time I could try working a bit at a hostel to save on accommodation whenever I feel like staying in a hostel and get tired of camping. 

Any ideas on how to save money on such a trip? If you’ve actually done the panamerican yourself I would greatly appreciate your responses in particular and I’d love to hear what kind of budget you managed yourself!",Shoestring

934,Visiting Spain for a week!,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend are planning on visiting Spain in August. We have not decided flight dates yet but it will probably be in the first weeks of the month. We're from Portugal so flight costs aren't *a big deal* (given that the flights cost around \~50€ total for each person) but we're a bit stale on what to actually visit. Our idea was to go straight to Madrid and stay there for a couple of days (perhaps even 1 or 2 more days) and then catch a train to Valencia (pictures online were marvelous). 

&amp;#x200B;

Our vacation idea isn't really a *hit the beach and relax* type of thing but we would like to mix that with visiting historic monuments (our first idea was to hit Rome but we didn't manage to make it, perhaps another time). From what I saw, I'm not really sure if Madrid is the type of city you'd want to visit in order to see monuments and such (it seems like Madrid is a commercial city, with no **big** history judging by the pictures/reviews I saw online - kinda like Milan). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nontheless, even I'm wrong and Madrid (and Valencia) **is** indeed a beautiful city to visit, I would like to get people's opinions on reserving hotel rooms online (trivago or booking are **most likely** our only options since they are the most known companies here). Is it safe given that these companies work as middle-men between you and the actual hotel? Isn't it better to straight up call the hotel and make a reservation? (is it more expensive?)

&amp;#x200B;

And what about train tickets? Is *thetrainline* website a safe place to buy them? Anything we need to take into account?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also be open to suggestions about others cities rather than the ones we planned on going. Barcelona isn't really a choice since my girlfriend has been there for 3 times now and I really don't want to make her re-visit almost everything again, perhaps on a later date.",Shoestring

938,Disney World or Abroad Vacation?,"My husband and I are wanting to go our our honeymoon sometime this fall. The wedding really drained our bank accounts so we've had to wait a year to save up to go somewhere, but we're still pretty low on funds. The original plan was to go to Disney because I have never been before, but I am worried that's going to still be too expensive to make work. I was told that going out of country for a honeymoon would actually be less expensive than in country so now we're considering that as well. So I'm wondering which you think would be a better deal? Disney World or Abroad somewhere nice?

&amp;#x200B;

Some other possibly important info:

We live in Kentucky

We want at least a good part of this vacation to be relaxing, not adventure based

We want to stay at least a week, possibly longer

If we go to Disney we would also want to go to Universal at least for a day

We would greatly appreciate literally any tips for either Honeymoon option

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are saying abroad, which is great and all but I also would like to know suggestions for where to travel exactly. Abroad is much more vast than Disney so I wouldn't even know where to start.

Edit 2: Some corrections: I understand the Disney Park is not relaxing. If we pick Disney we plan on spending a good amount of time on the beach or at a friends condo (that has a pool) as well as at the parks. We would also drive down seeing as Florida actually isn’t that far from us and like I said, we have a place to stay for cheap. My budget is not $1000 as assumed by a lot of people. We have about $1200 give or take saved right now but still have time to save more as well as a credit card we already have designated for travel.",Shoestring

959,Traveled to Barcelona and Paris things I wish I would’ve known,"So for context I travelled from my city in the US through a connected international flight to Barcelona, from Barcelona to Paris, and then back to the US through a connected flight.

**Before you leave**

* I would exchange currency in the US, go IN ADVANCE to a big bank (Chase, Wells Fargo etc...) and request it. You can lose a big percentage if you exchange at the European airport exchange place or at certain exchange places in Barcelona. I cannot stress this enough look up the reviews for the exchange places and ask what the rates are, I went to what looked like a decent place with asian ladies, and got 30% of my value ripped off and I didn’t know I got hustled until it was too late. The place also had a 1 star on google reviews...
* Pack plenty of clothes and underwear, for the guys, have plenty of shirts and cut down on pants with shorts as you can use them multiple times. Definitely pack enough socks &amp; underwear especially if you are doing a beach day or something. Good comfortable shoes, if you want to do it all, you have to walk a lot.

**Flights**

* If you’re traveling through united (economy) you’re allowed a checked in bag for free, and a carry on, plus a backpack (as long as its not gigantic).
* They weren’t checking our carry on dimension wise leaving from the US, but they will from Barcelona to Paris, don’t over do your carry on make it look as small as possible.
* This is a big one, plan for the fact that traveling in Europe won’t grant you the same luggage as traveling from the US to Europe. As in traveling from Barcelona to Paris, you’re only allowed your checked in bag, and carry on ONLY. If you have anything else, they will charge you a 60 euro fine. The fine also applies to being overweight with your checked in bag so keep that in mind.
* When traveling back to the US, you have to understand that the TSA are not nice, and to keep your snacks food, whatever in your checked in bag, and do clothes only or non-edible in your carry on to avoid any problems.
* This is something I found at the airports and it can come in handy. You’re not allowed water bottles until you reach your gate at the airport terminals. So carry an empty water bottle, or a water bottle in your carry on (backpack). They have water fountains at the Barcelona, Paris, and Newark airports, whereas a sold water will cost you at least $2.50.
* My first time flying through a connected flight, they can the gates so watch out for that.

**Barcelona**

* It was so fun 😩😩🙌😊
* Perfect if you’re a uni student and want to go have fun
* Almost everybody speaks descent English, and if you speak Spanish its even better
* The whole city is run down with American uni students, and Americans in general so literally everytime someone bumped in to me it was a “I’m sorry” never a perdon.
* Get a metro pass for the time that you will be there, also they close the metro past a certain hour but you can use the bus, show them your metro card and ride for free
* The hours are really cool, a lot of places (pinchos restaurants) open up at 10:30 pm and close at 2:30 am
* So many attractions and things to do
* Never encountered the “ciesta” maybe its not followed in Barça
* Relatively inexpensive food (1 euro pinchos), and good :)
* Relatively inexpensive drinks, also a rule in the city you can’t buy alcohol after 11pm
* What to watch out for: if people outside of a place are trying really hard to get you to go, don’t. Tables outside are cute but its not descent food, and way to expensive. There was a big plaza (or cathedral) with restaurants all around it, avoid it. The descent places will be more hidden or you can try google maps.
* I never really felt unsafe, except for that one time we got lost in shady place, but literally all the time as long if you travel with people you are 100% fine. If you’re really late lots of street vendors will come up to you and try to sell you shit which is kind of annoying.

**Paris**

* Not a party city I would say, definitely more for couples
* Subway more complicated than the one in Barça they don’t call out the stops you have to look at the walls and see the name of the stop painted to know where you are.
* Museums are really good, but make sure you have tickets for the Louvre ahead of time (get them online), and that goes for the Palace of Versailles as well, I don’t recommend the catacombs waste of time outside. Do the big museums, Eiffel tower summit, Arch (have to buy a ticket to go to rooftop again online), Versailles palace + gardens (the gardens made the trip worth it), visit Notre Dame, gardens, and walk around the museum district.
* Food A LOT more expensive and not as good as the one in Barça (expect to eat crêpes)
* Everything is just more expensive, and beer very limited, they offer rosé or white wine, free water at most restaurants unlike in Barça
* Hours for food are kind of bad, most places close at 3 pm, then open up at 7 pm and close at midnight. Past midnight everything is pretty much closed.
* English is very limited here, and locals don’t like the fact that they have to speak English, and you not French
* Holy shit I almost forgot. If you’re carrying heavy luggage don’t take a train from the airport, plan ahead it will be a nightmare. A lot of steps, not worth it.
* VALIDATE YOUR TRAIN PASS AT THE MACHINE, the machines are in French and don’t make this explicit. If you buy a 5 day subway pass, validate it by inputing it into the machine itself where it will stamp a date on it, officially validating it, if the police stop you without you doing this will be a big issue. Also get the printed receipt just in case.
* Not as safe as in Barcelona I would say, but I never felt in danger. Always be in a group when traveling especially at night, near the big attractions.

985,Carry on baggage question,"Hello.

My friend and I are planning on doing a 2 week trip to Austria. We have a budget and when looking at flights, checking in baggage is too expensive (like $160 roundtrip each). We planned on just checking one bag, but now we just rather take a backpack and a carry on each.

Carry on limits, according to the website I am getting tickets from ([Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com), which gets info from the airlines, I believe), is 7 kg. The return trip is 8 kg.

I just packed my carry-on bag as if I were traveling tomorrow (without packing toiletry bag, a sweater, and little misc items like belts) and the bag weighed 7.5 kg already. We want to have our backpacks as empty as possible to pack the items we buy during the trip.

Supposing the carry on bags weigh 9 kg or 10 kg when traveling, is this going to be a big deal? How strict are airlines with this? Do they weigh the bag?

I imagine low-cost airlines may be more strict... does anyone has experience with Norweigan, XL France, Laudamotion, EuroWings, Austrian Air? Those are airlines serving the flights we are looking at.

We just want to save money and have enough for the actual trip, and I can't believe that 2 kg or 3 kg would be a reason to make us check a small bag. Also, I have had check-in people not weigh my carry-on bag before, and when they do, I have had them not care about an excess of a kilogram or two. Should I expect the same from the airlines I mentioned?

We managed to keep everything under $4000 USD without sacrificing our overall enjoyment of the vacation. Here's an overview of the trip:

* Origin: United States (east coat)
* Glasgow, Scotland (4 days)
* Edinburgh, Scotland (4 days)
* Dublin, Ireland (5 days)
* Reykjavik, Iceland (3 days)

And here is a breakdown of our spending over the course of 16 days (rounded for easier math):

* **Accomodations: $850.** We stayed  in AirBnB's. In most cases we had a private room with shared kitchen/living area, and in Iceland we had our own ""tiny home.""
* **Airfare: $870.** Our long-haul flights were $790 (Icelandair with a free 3-day stopover) and we also took an $80 Ryanair flight to Dublin. What really kept our cost down was not having any checked bags. We brought 40L backpacks as our carry-ons.
* **Local transport: $670.** This includes Ubers to our airport and back (cheaper than parking fees), local buses, trains for day trips and to get to Edinburgh, and our rental car in Iceland (plus insurance/gas/parking). We also took a couple of Ubers to make it easier to find our AirBnBs from the airport.
* **Food: $900.** We averaged around $55 per day. We typically just ate out one meal per day (usually lunch) and cooked everything else in our AirBnB. We both don't like to drink a lot of alcohol, so that definitely helped to keep the cost down.
* **Attractions: $240.** Personally we like to to spend most of our time exploring nature and checking out historical sites, so we avoided a lot of the pricey touristy stuff. Of course there were a few must-see sights that we paid to go to, including Edinburgh Castle, the Guiness Brewery, the Irish Whiskey Museum, and Iceland's Secret Lagoon. This also includes tips for a few free walking tours that we went on.
* **International medical insurance: $50**. Just a basic package.

**That brings our total cost to roughly $3600**. We're very happy to have come out under budget, especially when we really did not feel like we were skimping. It was definitely not a ""luxurious"" vacation but we had a ton of fun and made some lifelong memories. I'll summarize by just giving a few tips to help others save some money on their travels.

* Be flexible with your destination. We knew we wanted to fly to Europe with Icelandair to take advantage of their free stopover, but we weren't committed to a specific destination in Europe. We researched which cities were cheapest to fly into and out of, and kept our eyes peeled for good deals.
* Skip the international phone plans. We just used wifi and were completely fine. Pro tip: you can use location services without any data!
* Don't eat out too much. While food is an important part of travel, we didn't mind cooking a lot of our meals. It saved us a lot of money and also is something we enjoy doing to wind down at the end of the day.
* Take advantage of free attractions, like walking tours, hikes, museusm, etc.",Shoestring

1004,Looking into booking México City for 5 days during Labor Day,"Hey y’all! I’m looking into a 5 day trip to Mexico City for Labor Day. We have only been to the beach towns in Mexico so I’m going to need to some recommendations on this one!

What are some of the best areas to stay in? We are looking to hit up a lot of the historical sites the city has to offer and just wander around aimlessly. Are there certain areas we should avoid? 

We will be taking a day trip to Teotihuacan and want to know the best way out there. Would a day tour be good for this or would you recommend renting a car? We certainly don’t want to be rushed while we are here but I’m not so keen on renting a car. Is there public transportation that will take us to and from there so we don’t have a time restraint? 

What are the prices for food and beer in the city? We aren’t looking for fancy restaurants besides maybe a nice dinner one night. We are not looking for Americanized restaurants and we both thoroughly enjoy authentic Mexican food. 

Any other helpful ideas are always more than welcome too! 

Thanks everyone!",Shoestring

1009,Itinerary Help: Florida Keys,"Hoping some of you can help me out! My girlfriend and I were planning a trip down to the Keys in between some time in Orlando and Miami during September. The plan is to make the drive from Orlando to Key West stopping at some places along the way, but our first night in the Keys being Key West. From there, we would make our way back north to spend a couple days in Miami before flying home. The trouble is that it seems like there is a ton of things to do in the Keys and nothing seems *too* far away so I am struggling to try and schedule everything. Any thoughts on our list of activities (what we should add to the list, what we have that is over-hyped, etc.) would be much appreciated. Also of course, commenting on how much time you think we need to dedicate towards any specific activity! Below is the daily breakdown we are currently thinking:
- Day1: Leave Orlando early and stop for snorkeling at  John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo (2.5hrs). Once done, continue on our journey and stop in Marathon at The Turtle Hospital (~1hr). Complete the journey and arrive in Key West where we can do a tour of Hemingway House (1hr) and attend the Sunset Celebration in Mallory Square (2hrs) before hitting up Duval Street for dinner/drinks. (Lodging TBD)
- Day2: Free-time until grabbing lunch at Cuban Coffee Queen (1hr) and heading to Little Palm Island Resort/Spa. (Not too much detail on their website, but it seems like this may be under construction.)
- Day3: Islamorada - we'd like to hike at Long Key State Park, but their website lists no reservations through Dec/2019. I assume this is for camping and not a closure of the entire park, but still need to do research. (Lodging TBD)
- Day4: Start our drive to Miami and would like to include more road-trip stops like we did on day 1 along the way before checking into the Miami hotel.
- Day5: Open day for Miami activities (I am assuming heavy on the beach, but we'd love additional ideas as well as restaurant/night-time activities!)
- Day6: Same as above, but we fly out of MIA that night (after 5PM).

As you can tell, the other days are looser than the first so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",travel
1010,What medium do you use to plan your travels?,"Hello Travelers! 

Wanted to see what methods everyone used to plan out their travels. Old school pen and paper? Apps? Word documents? A combination? 

I find myself using a note pad but when I have everything compiled, I end up rewriting the whole thing so it's actually legible... and then it's difficult to transport etc. It just doesn't seem like the most effective way, but it does feel good to have something solid. Wanted to check with the community and see what methods my fellow travelers are using.

1011,Have you ever seen the church in the cave of the mountain? What if I say it is beautiful place in Cairo hidden from tourist? Lets explore!,"There was time in my life which I spent in Cairo, Egypt. I've lived and worked there for 7 months and all my free time I've dedicated to explore country with the greatest history (in my opinion). Beside The Great Pyramid of Giza, Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, fabulous Luxor &amp; Aswan and other famous locations there are magnificent places which is not that popular. 

Today, I would like to show you one of it. I was lucky to find it thanks to the project called ""Around Egypt in 60 days"" - the Egyptian couple who travels over the Egypt and showing the best places to visit on their Instagram. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Saint Simon the Tanner Hall &amp; ST. Mark's Church*

**First, lets read some facts:**

This huge cave was discovered in the year 1974. It was full of hundreds of tons of stones even up to the ceiling of the cave (which is 17 meters high from the ground), and was later prepared to contain ""St.Simon the Tanner Hall"" and ""St. Mark's Church""  
It was prepared to contain two storeys. The upper storey is ""ST. Simon the Tanner Hall"" prepared to accommodate 2000 people in spiritual meetings. The walls are decorated with many wonderful pictures engraved on the rocks representing scenarios from the Bible. The most unique scenery is of Jesus Christ opening His arms for all those who ask for Him.   
The lower storey is ""St. Mark's Church"", which was named after St. Mark the first preacher in Egyptian heritage. It was inaugurated in March 1993. 

The church dome at the Hall entrance is decorated from the outside by three great artistic pieces made of small colored mosaic , on top of the dome representing important scenes from the Bible ( crucifixion, Resurrection, rising to heaven).

**How to find it?**

It is  located in the Mokattam Mountain. First adventure is a short drive through the so called ""Garbage City’ – a large population of garbage collectors or Zabbaleen that live there. My advice to you - get some air fresher. It is smelly. But it worth it!

1012,How Do People Travel?,"So my friend posted on Instagram a post about travel. How it was a choice and just a question about priorities and how everything she earns goes on stuff she wants to do 'today' and less focused on 'tomorrow' and says how everyone has a choice.

But I don't get it. Surely to travel you need savings, no? How do you pay for accomodation, food and all that if you're travelling? No one's going to hire you for a week! I'm struggling to pay rent in my own home and hardly have enough money for 'today'. Which also leads to, surely you need to be thinking in the future? Expenses coming up cost money.

I want to give up everything and go travelling so bad! I am happy to give up my life here but the furthest I could get is a couple miles down the road before my fuel runs out and I don't have the money to top up? It's just the money? How do people do it if they don't have saving or a re stinking rich or rich parents?

1013,Would LA -&gt; SF or SF-&gt;LA make more sense (by car)?,"Hi guys,

I'm planning on spending a month in SF in October (and then flying to Mexico for Día de Muertos) and I was wondering if it would make more sense to fly into LA and drive up the coast and inland to Yosemite then back to SF or the other way around (SF &gt; Yosemite &gt; coastal drive down to LA after my month in SF). Also, is there anything else more out of the way that I might want to include in the LA-SF (or SF-LA) portion of the trip?

I was also thinking about getting a car for like a week there (i.e. separately from the SF-LA driving portion) and doing day (or overnight) trips to some places. I guess it would make most sense to visit places to the North of SF this way (Redwood National Park, Napa etc. - I guess Lake Tahoe is too far).

&amp;#x200B;

Before you say a month in SF is a lot and it's an expensive place, yeah, I know, but I like to explore slowly and am willing to spend money (within reason, so not like $15,000) on this portion of my trip.

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve done a lot of online research but are struggling to find 1 or 2 standout hikes we can do while we are there. We will stop by for a photo op at the Church of San Giovanni on the drive in from Innsbruck but so far that is all that is set in stone.

The Puez-Odle Altopiano is one we’ve considered, as we are more keen for a difficult hike with less people and rewarding views. While we have a car, I’m not sure though if trailhead parking lots are a thing there?

Additionally, I just planned to take running shoes as I don’t have hiking boots at the moment, and just running shoes have been fine for day hikes with little weight in the past (also have strict EasyJet bag restrictions), but don’t know if that would be a bad idea for the Dolomites.

1040,Question about free baggage,"Hello,

I have asked this question recently, but wasn't able to get the final answer, so I will try it again with more details.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to book a flight from europe to australia. It will be 3 flights in total. One with scandinavian airlines and two with air india. The question is about baggage. It is written that I can take 2 bags of registered baggage:

I have checked both airlines wepages and found that in scandinavian airlines the policy is:

And with air india:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wbdlgbd79a931.jpg

They have pretty different dimensions of baggage and also different weights.

&amp;#x200B;

So as I understand that if I would want to avoid any problems scandinavian airlines, I can take 2 bags, both about \~20 kilos. Total 40 kg?

&amp;#x200B;

It is a bit weird if I could take 40kg with this offer, because more expensive flights offer 30kg baggage.",travel

Obviously not every American tourist visits only these areas the first time they travel to Australia, but I would say that almost every other set of Americans we met in Australia was doing some combination of these areas without any additions (which seems perfectly rational, since my wife and I really enjoyed each of these areas).

1043,Where to go for one week?,"Hello! I am surprising my wife with a trip to Dublin this November.  We've both wanted to go to Ireland for a while and I'd like this trip to kick off an annual traveling tradition.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are both full time students and employees, so one week- ten days abroad is about all we can afford.  I'd like a trip somewhere in between ""I drive a 2 year old Mercedes back home"" and ""I eat Ramen every night"".  AirBnb based is great, and we're good with getting breakfast and lunch at stores in the country rather than restaurants.    I did a lot of research and saw this is quite possible in Ireland as we will have 5 days, after the two days of travel, in the city after travel and can do Killarney or such for one of those days.   


So my question is where are other places we could go next year where 5-10 days gives us enough time to see most of what that city/area is about?  I was thinking Geneva, but a very brief look into it showed that it's VERY expensive.  


Quick helpful info:  We're Americans. We would have about $4-5k each year for travel for the time being.  I'd like to see Italy, Germany and a Scandinavian country at some point.

I want to travel to america and started a request for the visa on a third party site. My girlfriend send me the site saying that she got hers from there (2 years ago). 
I started filling in the form without really reading. I filled in my credit card for the reservation payment. Not even knowing the price for a visa at this site. Afterwards I get a page with the  full form to fill in.  There I see a lot  of questions regarding legal issues which I need to fill in. I then stop the application because there are a few legal things I need to fix before applying for the visa. I figured this wouldn’t be a problem, because I only filled in my name and email address and stupidly filled in my credit card information.

I then immediately send them an email that I would like to cancel my reservation, because I don’t have the right information or documents to complete the application for a visa. 

They respond saying. I have used their service and because they did ‘work’ I cannot get a full refund. The price they claimed for 2 visa ‘requests’ was 178 euro. The price they are willing to refund is 50 euro. 

I am confused on what to do. I know that I was very reckless with filling in my cc information. 
I thought because I didn’t actually apply for the visa that this wouldn’t be a problem. I mean what kind of work can u do for a visa request without having information regarding the persons?

I would like to get some advice on what to do in this situation. I have contacted my bank and would like some more more information.

1051,Peru itinerary questions including how long to spend in Cusco?,"I'm heading to Peru on a solo trip in August for 12 days, first time in South America! My itinerary as of now looks like:

1. Land in Lima around 9am
2. Lima
3. Lima - fly to Arequipa around 6pm
4. Arequipa
5. Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek
6. Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek
7. Arequipa - fly to Cusco in the morning
8. Cusco
9. Cusco - Aguas Calientes
10. Aguas Calientes/Macchu Pichu - back to Cusco
11. Cusco - may get rid of this day in Cusco and spend an extra day in Lima to go to Paracas OR hike Laguna 69 - worth it?
12. Cusco - Lake Humantay trek
13. Cusco - fly home

Questions for people who have been to any of these cities:

1. Does my order of things in Cusco seem okay - giving myself enough time to acclimatize, not doing Humantay the day after MP, enough/too much time to hang out in Cusco itself?
2. Is Paracas worth the day trip since my schedule is tight? I have done a bit of boat rides along rocky coastline and wildlife viewing in various places around the world so I'm not sure if my time is better spent in Cusco/Sacred Valley.
3. I'm on the fence about Sacred Valley - if I ended up doing Pisac and/or Ollantaytambo, is the best option to go on my way to Aguas Calientes via train? Open to opinions on these places that would help me decide whether to stop or not. I'm not super interested in seeing a ton of ruins but the Pisac market sounds interesting and I'm sure I would enjoy the scenery.
4. Has anyone done the Humantay trek and what did you think of it?
5. The Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek looks great, I love hiking and am in great shape. I've heard everything about it from it's great, to it's extremely tough, to it's not that impressive - anyone have any more input?
6. Anything that won't pop up in a guidebook that you would say is a must-do in any of these cities? (somewhat off the beaten touristy path)

1074,Possible problems traveling to the US from Canada with a one-way ticket?,"For some context:

I'm in a long distance relationship with my fiance whose mother is terminally ill and has anywhere from weeks to months left to live. Of course, her situation may deteriorate very quickly in the span of a few days - anything can happen - so I have no clue when she will pass. Obvious enough; but on that note, I want to be there for her and my fiance during this time, throughout her end-of-life days and thereafter. 

And so, without knowing exact dates, it seems pointless to book a return flight for a day I can only blindly pick. I know legally it's not required to gain entry, but ultimately my admission is under the discretion of the border official(s). I realize this may cause issues at the border once I arrive, so what can I do to prepare for any questions if I do go this route? Or is it even worth the risk? I should add I may be leaving my job prior to my trip, (with every intention of finding another once I return) which may bring up an unwanted red flag with border officials concerned about ties to my home country/financial details.

1078,Percentage of annual income/budget spent on travel,"Hi folks,

I’m just curious as to what % of your annual budgets you all spend on travel and if there’s any trends to be spotted within the r/travel community. I’m an accountant by trade and was a bit shocked today when I realised that this year I have/will be spending 13.5% of my gross annual income on my various trips. I can afford this and it is my primary hobby/interest but I still surprised myself. My income has increased by roughly 40% over the last 4 years but the percentage spent on travel has always been about the 12/13% mark so in theory my spend now should be lower but I seem to have the travel version of lifestyle inflation. My trips in the last few years have been to further destinations but also with nicer accommodation and I’ve been more likely to do expensive activities eg a hot air balloon ride. 

Have you noticed any trends like this in your own travel and how do you feel about it? Sometimes I sense a bit of judgement from family/friends/coworkers as to many people travel is seen as such a luxury so sometimes I feel a bit guilty/embarrassed about my spending but it really is the only hobby I’m really passionate about!

1084,California /Arizona Roadtrip 2 Weeks in Feb 2020. What should we visit and what should we skip.,"Hey there guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

We (me 31M and my wife 27F) are planing to go for a 2 week vacation to California. This is our first time in US so we are not quite sure which way should we go and what is most important/interesting things to see. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some info about us:** 

* We are from Europe. From Lithuania to be exact. Now living in Germany. 
* Normally we like Nature more than the Cities
* Our goal is to do a ''real American'' road trip you see in a movies. (driving the roads with no cars at all, sleeping in small hotels by the highway, etc)
* We also don't want to spend very much money. I Didn't think about our exact budget yet, but for sure we are not planing to eat in fancy restaurants, go clubbing, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Map Explanations:** 

* First picture below is based on our preferences what we think we need to see. As Grand Canyon is ''must'' for us. Would you add something or delete from the map? 
* Second picture is what I found googling about ''perfect road trip in California''  Which one would you prefer? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions and concerns:** 

* I would easily skip San Francisco, however I would really want to visit Yosmite National Park. On the other hand the weather should be bad there in Feb and it will take too much of driving. Not sure if we should just skip it. Thoughts? 
* We are planing to stay 1,5 days in Hollywood once we arrive and approx 2 last days of our stay in Venice beach. I did read that quite a lot of people are saying that 2 days in LA is enough as the city is nothing special at all. Is that right? I was under the impression, that we need to spend as much time as possible there as the city is huge and offers a lot to see and do. Any opinions?  
*  I was thinking to rent a car only for the road trip and use public transportation in LA itself. However I seen in here that it's much easier to check the city with a car. Is this true? As normally I always use a public transportation when visiting City's i have never been before.  
* We will book Air bnb accommodations only for the first and last few days in LA. Will there be a possibility just to stop at some small hotels when feeling tired while doing the trip? What about prices? 
* Do we need to google some of the hotels and pre-book the room or we can just stop wherever we want? 
* What are the meal prices in diners on a high way? 
* We are planing to spend a half of a day and a night in Vegas, however we are not interested in Casinos or Partying. Is it worth it?

1087,ESTA - U.S. Point of Contact (but I don't have any),"In order to complete the ESTA application, I need to provide a **U.S. Point of Contact Information**, which can be filled in with ""UNKNOWN"" (but the fields are mandatory).  


However, the FAQ on ESTA's website mentions the following:

&gt;**Can I apply for an ESTA without having confirmed travel plans?**  
Yes. Specific travel plans are not mandatory at the time of application, **but you will need a U.S. point of contact.**  
Although specific travel plans are not required, the address where  you will be staying in the United States is recommended to complete the  application. If multiple locations are planned, you only need to enter  the first address. If a complete address is not known, you can enter the  name of the hotel or location you will visit.  
If you are in transit, please select 'yes' to the 'Is your travel  to the U.S. occurring in transit to another country?' question in the  Travel Information section.

Notice the bold emphasis on the answer? It says I **need** to have a U.S. point of contact. However, I am applying for the ESTA way before I book any hotel reservations, hence, I can't put the name of a hotel. How should I proceed? I mean, I could book a hotel, but if I changed it, wouldn't the U.S. point of contact be immediately outdated? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the ""U.S. point of contact"" field being mandatory and unchangeable?",travel

1089,Need vacation ideas for a budget minded couple,"Hey Everyone!

As the title says, I need vacation ideas for my girlfriend and I's birthdays (30 &amp; 35). We want to travel anytime between 27th of July, to the first week of September, for a max of 4 nights/5 days. It can't be any earlier or later in the year unfortunately. 

Cost: Her total which would include everything is $900 MAX (which I already explained to her for most popular destinations, will probably not cover it given the time frame in which we want to travel). I can go a little higher, but don't want to spend more than maybe $1.1-1.2k which should include everything (travel, food, activities).

Activities: I like outdoorsy activities (ATVs, ziplining, hiking, ect.) but I also love pools/beaches/lounging, I just don't want that to be the bulk of the trip. She loves the beach/pools, but is open to other activities like the ones I mentioned. We both like the idea of theme parks, but I'm not a huge fan of roller coasters or rides in general, whereas she is (We did Universal a couple of years ago, and I had a good time despite not going on many rides).

Things I've researched: Me personally, I would love to take a trip to Puerto Vallarta, but the flights to get there are astronomically expensive for us. I checked out all inclusive vacations, but from what I've read on here, it makes more sense financially to fly there, get an AirBnB (the ones I found look fantastic and they're cheap, but the flights are crazy expensive) and find things to do ourselves, please correct me if I'm wrong on this. I looked into Disney world, Disneyland, and some cruises, but again, it's going way over our altogether budget of $2k. I messaged Magical Vacations to see what deals they can offer me, but I know they're basically only good for hotel/park tickets, I would need to take care of travel arrangements. We considered cruises (which I need to do more research on), but she's a little hesitant about them given the horror stories she's heard, and she's afraid of getting sea sick.

At this point, I'm just looking for some good ideas for a couples vacation, for under $2k (local or international, doesn't matter we both have our passports and I have a drivers license), or maybe major discounts/fixes or tweaks on things I already mentioned. 

Thank you for your time!

1105,Convincing my parents that I (22m American) will be safe traveling Morocco alone the last week of August,"Title says it all, as always. I've been working on planning my own graduation trip for a few weeks now and I have a general itinerary down: land in Tangier, stay for a couple nights, Chefchaouen for one night then on to Marrakech for the remaining few nights, including a day trip to Essouira. I was thinking of doing airbnb's in the first two cities, maybe a hotel in Marrakech?

Obviously this all is contingent on the following: my parents really don't want me to go. My dad had some super negative travel experiences when he was my age (in the US and Europe) and thinks I do not appreciate how dangerous it is to travel solo.

I'm a decently experienced traveler, just me and my SO did London and Brussels last summer together, my whole family has gone round Europe together too. All that sounds annoying, I just mean that I'm no stranger to dealing with tourist scams and street hustlers. (I know that even Paris is not necessarily as aggressive as Morocco's medinas would be).

I guess the concern is I haven't really traveled alone before? And they say why not just ask a friend: I don't want a friend. I feel like solo travel is particularly rewarding and I've read Morocco is a particularly exciting place to have that experience, and I feel like I'm ready. Am I wrong?

I am a Canadian conducting research (excavation) in Italy with a Visa (Studio Post-Laurea) valid as of June 30th.

This was approved. 



I've just submitted my Permesso Di Soggiorno and my appointment at the Questura is in September.

While online research tells me this is permitted for a permisso for lavoro, I can't find any official confirmation that this is the same for permesso for studio.

1116,Dubai - interesting notes,"1. Fines

Payments for fines are usually written on warnings. It is useful. 1 AED = 0,5$. Driving through a red light will cost 30k$ if you are bump into a tram.

We have been learning their rules before our trip especially about clothes. You should have covered shoulders and knees. But in fact, a lot of people break rules. When you leave a beach security guard will ask you to wear your clothes.

2) Month of Ramadan

Muslims don't eat from dawn to dusk in this month. It means that nobody can eat something on the streets in the daytime. Windows of cafes and restaurants are closed in the daytime. We bought ice cream and wanted to eat it under the sun but it was prohibited. I understand that it helps Muslims but I saw a billboard with a sandwich. Even ice cream carts are covered but the billboard is allowed.

3) Advertisement

There is a little amount of advertisement in the streets. Most of them are shop signs. There are a few billboards. It makes the city looks better. I noticed that prostitutes advertise themselves by business cards on pavements in the streets.

4) Porn

It is prohibited and blocked here. I can't watch. It is said that fine for this is from 1m$ to 1 year in prison. But one local man said that it is hooey.

5) Uber

It is nonsense but Uber is more expensive than the ordinary state taxi. It comes to the hotel for 1-2 minutes and cheaper for 20-30%. One ride costs 7$.

6) Parking

There are few places for parking in the streets but nobody breaks the rules. They have a high penalty for this and confiscation car. You should have a clear car even you leave in parking and go on holidays.

7) Tube

There is an underground railway carriage exclusively for women and children.

8) Coins

Unexpectedly in the Arabian country, there are no Arabic or Roman numerals. I can't guess money value indicated on coins there.

We really like the underground environment, we feel very attracted to Hip-Hop music so if there is a concert we would love to go there. We do not want to go shopping and spend all our money, although we would love to make a special purchase somewhere unique. 

We love doing activities on the city (plays, concerts, riding...), if there are, of course. We aren't night owls, but we like to spend some nights exploring the nightlife. 

A point in favor would be the legalization, I'd like to have a bit of weed for two weeks. But this isn't the most important thing

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know some options of your choice, and if its possible why you choosed that. If you choose a state, please tell me which cities of that state would suit the most.

1122,Taiwan Itinerary Check!,"Hi guys, 

My girlfriend and I are heading to Taiwan at the start of Jan next year for 11 days. Currently this is our plan. 

\- Taipei Day 1  
\- Alishan Day 2-3  
\- Heng Chun/Kenting Day 3-6  
\- Hualien Day 6-10  
\- Taipei Day 11  


We've narrowed it down to these. However, I'm having some mix feelings about kenting because I've been reading around and its seems like a tourist trap with not much to do and it also seems like its horribly hard to get to hualien to kenting. What do you guys think? Is it worth it to head to kenting, or should we head to somewhere else?

Me and my friend are planning a trip to Scotland and Ireland from the end of September to mid October.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware it is getting quite cold during that time but I figured that if we start at Scotland we will be evading the weather as it gets colder and colder (fingers crossed).

&amp;#x200B;

Our budget is not really limited (though we are not planning to stay in hotels ,more like hostels / motels if thats possible)

We do want to rent a car throughout the entire period or whatever time necessary .

We really love country-side scenery, castles,  whisky  - especially the Islay ones and Puffins :D, and we also really love Guinness

What we are less interested in is museums.

We are very interested of doing at least one whole day hike if weather permits it.

1126,First Solo Trip Advice: 15 Days in Spain &amp; Paris,"I'm currently planning my first solo trip to Spain and France in November. It'll be my first real international solo trip (the US doesn't feel like it counts as someone from Canada), while also being my second trip to Europe. This'll also be my first time staying in mostly hostels, for economic and social reasons. I tend to prefer to stick to myself on solo trips when in the US but I feel I need this change of pace to open up a bit. &gt;!My Raptors also lost Kawhi and I need to not think about basketball this Fall.!&lt;  I'm personally interested in experiencing/seeing architecture, a new different culture, and history, with some good photographic opportunities. I also really enjoy alcohol, but don't intend to get party-drunk, more social drinking for this trip.

I've currently budgeted at least $2000 CAD for accomodations (flight(s) + hostels + rail pass), and right now I'm estimated to be around $1800 if my math is correct. I've already shortlisted some hostels/airbnbs for each city, many of which come from recommendations based on this sub and HostelWorld. I plan on booking everything end of this week or this weekend, ideally. I would also have around $2000 CAD to play with for food, day trips, and amenities. 

Based on research and insight provided by this sub, the solo travel sub, and from friends, I drew up this interim itinerary. Paris takes up the second leg of my trip due to it being cheaper to catch a return flight back home to Toronto, for some reason. However, I'd like some critique on what I've laid out so far. 

* Day 1: Toronto &gt; Madrid
* Day 2: Madrid - Segovia Day Trip
* Day 3: Madrid &gt; Seville (Train)
* Day 3: Seville - Cordoba Day Trip
* Day 4: Seville
* Day 5: Seville &gt; Granada (Train)
* Day 6: Granada - Alhambra
* Day 7: Granada flight to Barcelona
* Day 8: Barcelona - Montserrat Day Trip
* Day 9: Barcelona (Thinking about Giron Day Trip?)
* Day 10: Barcelona &gt; Paris (by Train)
 * Explore Montmartre Area (I plan on staying in this area!)
* Day 11: Paris - Walk along Seine River 
 * Arc de Triomphe &gt; Eiffel Tower &gt; Seine River &gt; Notre Dame (;_;) &gt; Latin Quarter
* Day 12: Paris - Louvre &gt; Latin Quarter again lol
* Day 13: Paris - Army Museum &amp; Napoleon's Tomb
* Day 14: Paris - Versaille
* Day 15: Paris flight back to Toronto

I just wanted to grab a second opinion on how I'm allocating my days and time, considering my transportation options and amount of days. I've messed around with the idea of going directly to Seville upon arriving to Madrid, and then going Seville &gt; Granada &gt; Madrid (1.5 days 2 nights) &gt; Barcelona instead, to take advantage of the railpass instead of flying out of Granada. But I'd like a second opinion on that idea. I've dug up train schedules for this month and next, and I'm kind of just assuming it will be similar come November. 

I was also wondering if any of my day trip choices are valid in the interest of time. I've done my research and found they tend to be within an hour or a bit more to do day trips from their respective cities, but again, second guessing myself etc etc. I am worried about burning myself out so I'm just listing ideas, but whatever happens happens. I am used to the constant hustle and long days, but I am sort of hoping the spirit of adventure keeps me alive.

1127,How to travel by Train from Nijmegen (NL) to Belluno (IT),"Hii all!

I was planning to go on vacation with 3 good friends of mine to go camping in Belluno Italy. We had in mind to buy plane tickets but were too late with buying tickets so right now they go over the counter for a price of 330 euro which we think is a LOT. We considered traveling by car but since we dont own a car ourselves and I'm the only one with a license it didn't seem like a real good fit. 

""Why not by train?"" we thought, well since there are 3 borders that we have to cross it seems like a though solution since we only know how the train works in NL. I want to figure out how this works by gathering information and i thought this subreddit might have some people willing to help out with some tips on how to arrange a travel like that.

1132,I goofed up on my ESTA application,"Hello all. UK Citizen here.

I posted previously about my trip to LA being arranged for a couple weeks time (flights and hotel booked already) My ESTA was deemed unauthorised for travel and at first I was thinking it was because I am self employed which was strange as I've been approved for like 4/5 ESTAs in the past with zero issues and I am squeaky clean when it comes to records/health etc.

After further review I realised under the eligibility questions that no sane person would answer yes to (don't ask how I did it) I answered 'yes' to having a physical/mental disorder/being a drug abuser having Ebola/Smallpox/Yellow Fever etc which was a huge L on my part.

Phoning the Embassy was a bit of a myth as the operator just cut me off and sent me an unhelpful recorded message.

As I'm sure this isn't the first time that this has happened, am I able to reapply after 72 hours and change that question and get approved? Or will I still need to apply for a tourist visa?

If there's anyone in this SR who's experienced this any advice would be helpful!

I’m an Australian musician performing on a tour through Mexico and on my way through Benito Juarez airport travelling CDMX &gt; Tijuana I had an issue with security (not customs) confiscating a piece of musical equipment with no explanation as to why other than ‘you can’t have this’ (FYI, it was a drum pedal that I’ve travelled with for many years with no issues). 

As it’s a quite pricey piece of equipment ($600AUD  to replace) I filed a claim with my travel insurance company.

1151,First Impressions of South Korea (Solo),"I thought I would write this up from the perspective of someone who just arrived a few days ago. I usually see things from people who spent months, but they normally forget the small things. Here's my impression so far and thoughts for other travelers.

1. Learn to read Hangul. The trains and buses are fabulous, but the 'foreigner boards' are not always turned on/working. This makes finding your stop fun as you have to squint at the tracks on approach. Being able to sound out the words makes a big difference. Also, the tmoney card is great for the trains. I bought one in the station - note that it does not come with money on it. You have to take out the card and load money (usually cash) into it using any of the transit machines. Most trips cost 1200 krw (~$1). I personally did not use the tmoney card at convenience stores since I have a chase travel card that waives transaction fees.

2. Many people don't speak English. You don't have to be fluent in Korean. Know how to count in Chinese and Korean. Know how to ask for prices. How to ask where things are. Know how to say thank you and 'please give'. Those are the phrases I use the most and it gets me most of the way.

3. Download Naver Maps. Google Maps does not work in SK, so you're stuck with Naver. It's.. okay. You have to constantly look at it to keep track of where you are. Also, Seoul is huuuuuge. Make sure you give yourself time going district to district. Even on the train it can take over an hour to get from hongik to Gangnam.

4. You will get stared at, but not for long. I definitely had people stare at me on the train and buses, and most especially at restaurants. But they're not malicious, just curious I guess. 

5. Arrive early at the airport. If you can get a flight that arrives early you're in for a mostly empty airport and about 2 minutes through customs. It was a super lovely experience.

6. Menus are bilingual. Every restaurant, even the obscure ones, have several languages: English, Chinese, Japanese.

7. If you're a foreigner, you will have people barrage you for taxis, clothes, makeup, etc. I'm a white female so I don't know if this applies to everyone, but I felt targeted at every shopping district. They definitely thought I needed a taxi everywhere I went. So just be aware.

8. Subways are a bit crazy sometimes. If you get on the wrong train by accident, you're probably going to have to walk a half mile to get to the other side of the tracks. Most of the subway stops don't meet in the middle so it's inconvenient as hell. I've walked a metric ton in the past two days. Also, the trains have designated seats for elders and pregnant women. Just keep an eye out for those sections. I've almost sat in those seats by accident.

9. Bring water with you (summer). It is quite warm, and if you're visiting popular tourist places, they do not sell water inside. You should stop at a convenience store and grab water before going in. I almost died of thirst at the palace.

10. Be careful of guesthouses. I got a room in a guesthouse that had good reviews, but when I arrived they said the A/C was broken and they couldn't fix it. So I said screw it and got an expensive hotel (yes it's that hot). The hotels aren't terribly pricey compared to huge cities like New York or Tokyo.

11. Gangnam is pretty boring. I walked around the area for half the day today and it's just a posh area with not much to do besides go to spas. Hongik Station/Hongdae is fascinating. Although if you're over 35 it might not be your scene. Tons of younger, college kids.

12. Restaurants tend to serve meals for 2+ people. As a solo traveler, it was hard to get small portions at restaurants. The food was always really good, but I have yet to clear a plate.

13. Get the cold soup. I had it at a restaurant and from a street vendor. Delicious and refreshing both times in the boiling sun. Also, I thought I hated kimchi. No, I hate American Kimchi. The pickled vegetables have been insanely good at all restaurants.

14. You need to find an ATM with 'Global' banking allowed. There are atm's everywhere, but they don't allow foreign transactions. And if they do, they limit it to 100,000krw (~85usd). I tried five or six atm's before stumbling upon ibk bank. They have a Max of 800,000 krw, and I finally withdrew cash.

15. The most shocking thing is how uh.. rude? old people are. Not all of them, but I've been shoved aside by a few grannies on the train. Everyone else is nice, but I think it's part of the 'respect elders' thing. Just let them go first and avoid an elbow in the back.",travel

AA cancelled flight and can't get us home for 2 extra days, but won't recognize flights with other airlines?","So I'm not sure if this is an appropriate subreddit but since so many people travel a lot I thought ya'll may have experience with this situation and how to handle American Airlines customer service.

My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options.

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday.

The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&amp;#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&amp;#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&amp;#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&amp;#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

I'm planning my first trip to Yucatan, Mexico (solo) - I plan to be there for 9 days from July 12-21. 

Here's my itinerary so far - would love any feedback and tips! I'll be staying in hostels, and not sure yet if I'll be renting a car or taking the bus (open to suggestions!)

* Jul 12 - Arrive in Cancun @ 12pm, drive/bus to Merida

* Jul 13 - Uxmal in the morning, back to Merida for the afternoon/evening

* Jul 14 - Depart Merida, Izamal in the morning, Chichen Itza in the afternoon, arrive in Valladolid (should I just skip Izamal so that I can check out Chichen Itza super early before everyone arrives?)

* Jul 15 - Depart Valladolid, Ek Balam in the morning, Coba ruins in the afternoon, arrive in Tulum in the evening

* Jul 16 - Tulum - beaches, maybe Sian Ka'an

* Jul 17 - Depart Tulum in the morning, arrive in Isla Holbox in the afternoon

* Jul 18 - Isla Holbox (beach, relaxation, slower non-touristy pace)

* Jul 19 - Depart Isla Holbox, arrive in Isla Mujeres

* Jul 20 - Isla Mujeres (beach, relaxation, a bit more upbeat/nightlife)

* Jul 21 - Depart Isla Mujeres for Cancun Airport

I'd visit various cenotes in and around the areas as well, just haven't figured out which ones and when yet. 


**Questions/comments:**

* Is this itinerary too much? Should I take one spot out, so I can extend my stay in other places? 

* Are all these places doable by bus? Or is a rental car required?

* Ideally I'd love to check out Cozumel and the Las Coloradas as well, but I don't think I'll have time. Or should I go to Cozumel instead of Isla Mujeres?

* An alternative route would be to do this in reverse, i.e. Cancun -&gt; Tulum -&gt; Valladolid -&gt; Merida -&gt; Holbox -&gt; Mujeres -&gt; Cancun. Would that be a more logical route?",travel

I'll be traveling from July 25th to August 10th, flying in and out of EWR airport near New York City.

I'll already be in Philadelphia for work on the 25th. Then my girlfriend will arrive from EWR and will take a train to meet me in Philly.

I like to see nature AND cities. I have a somewhat limited budget but not so much as to limit my enjoyment (maximum $5k for two people for the whole trip).

The itinerary I have so far is:

July 25th -&gt; go to Philadelphia. Rent a car.

July 26th -&gt; See Philadelphia.

July 27th -&gt; Leave to Washignton DC, lunch in Baltimore, sleep in DC.

July 28th -&gt; DC

July 29th -&gt; DC

July 30th -&gt; Leave DC early morning and take a road trip to Atlantic City through Delaware (and the ferry between Delaware and the NJ coast). Stopping where we might please (maybe see a little bit of countryside Virginia?). Sleep in Atlantic City.

July 31st -&gt; See Atlantic City, go to Philly by the afternoon, drop the rented car and take a night train to Boston. Sleep on the train.

Aug 1st -&gt; Boston

Aug 7th -&gt; NYC

Aug 8th -&gt; NYC

I’m planning my next adventure! I would like to visit Greece for 3 weeks (Athens, Sifnos, Naxos, and Milos) in 2020, but am having a hard time choosing between visiting in June or September. 

From my understanding, neither are during the peak season (July, August). June will be warmer (I have read it can get up to 100° F, but read it will be generally cooler). The water will be warmer in September, and the temperature will be cooler (80° F). I have read that both months can have peak prices despite not being during peak season. Supposedly, some islands are “prettier” in June because not everything has baked in the sun all summer. However, school gets out in the middle of June which means there could be more people than in September?

Ideally, I would prefer to go in June, though I do plan on being out in the sun hiking and exploring most of the trip, so it is important it isn’t scorching (I am from Nor-Cal where it is frequently 100° F+ during the summer so I am used to it, though it is awful).

1175,Trying To Finalize Trip To Greece &amp; Israel with my GF - 14 Days,"Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to finalize a trip to Greece &amp; Israel. My main concern with this itinerary is that we may be doing too much with the flight to Tel-Aviv

&amp;#x200B;

**Rough Itinerary:**

\- Fly into Chania, Crete (2 Nights)

Flying into Chania where we'll be meeting my girlfriend's cousin who's stationed out on Crete (She's in the Navy). 

\- Rethymo (1 Night)

Staying a night in Rhythmo so we can take the ferry to Santorini in the morning. 

\- Rethymo --&gt; Santorini (3 Nights)

We may stay in Thira for all three nights but I'm not 100% on which locations will be the best. This looks like the most relaxing part of the trip as we won't be bouncing around from island to island or have to move luggage or check in/out of a hotel for a few days

\- Santorini --&gt; Crete, Malia (2 Nights in Malia)

We're going back to Crete (which I'm not the most excited about) due to my girlfriends cousin being stationed over in Malia. We're going to spend some time with her, though I feel there might be other island's I could hop to as opposed to going to Malia for a few nights? Not sure

\- Heraklion --&gt; Tel Aviv (1 Night) 

Flights into Tel Aviv we're the cheapest and had the best times. We thought of doing Israel due to the flights being so inexpensive but taking another flight after getting from the US to Greece seems like it might be a little too much, logistics wise. I don't think my girlfriend is considering just how many logistical situations going to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem may add. We're going to check out the night life and the ocean for a bit but one night seems to short change Tel Aviv. 

\- Tel Aviv &gt; Jerusalem (2 nights)

We're going to see the dead see as well as some other historical sights around Jerusalem but nothing is finalized as far as bus tours or day trips

\- Jerusalem &gt; Tel Aviv (1 Night)

Back to Tel Aviv as we need to fly out of Tel Aviv to catch the best flight to athens. Though, currently that flight leaves at 6:30am, which doesn't sound reasonable for an international flight back to Greece.

\- Tel Aviv &gt; Athens (2 Nights) - Fly out of Athens

Check out a few sights in Athens, then we fly back to the United states. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips or recommendations on if this is too much or if there may be a better way to plan this trip? I just did a trip from the US to Thailand and Bali in the same trip and going from Bangkok to Bali was too much, IMO. There wasn't enough time to appreciate either culture or country as much as I would have liked to. My concern is throwing a flight in the middle of our Greece trip might short change Israel AND Greece. Also, adding two flights in the middle of the trip may be more stress than seeking out the adventure in Israel. Thoughts, tips, suggestions?

1182,ADVICE: travelling to america with my family - immigration,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice to (hopefully) put my and my SO's mind at ease. We're UK based and are travelling to the states with our 1yr old for the first time this August for a holiday.

We went to Canada maybe 4yrs ago where I was held up at immigration. Backstory: In my teens, having never left the country, and being completely naive as to the legalities of the condition of a passport - while I was at a festival, I tore a page out of my passport purely because I needed a piece paper (I used it as ID before I got my drivers license). This was the one I used when we went to Canada. Subsequently they pulled me aside for an hour or so to check everything over. (no cavity search).

In the end I think they realised I was simply a dumbass, and allowed me entry with the condition that I get a temporary passport the next day, which we did and all was good.

That passport expired so I have my new - in *immaculate* condition passport - now, but my worry is, I'm thinking this incident is most probably on file somewhere, but most importantly, will it cause me any trouble with immigration when we get to the states? Thanks for any advice on this, really worried they'll see something and put me on the next flight back. Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone! Can't blame a guy for being neurotic about this stuff (and just, in life) when flying all that way, but everything you've said was spot on, greatly appreciated :)",travel
1183,Travelling made me less career driven,"This is something I've wanted to post for a long time.

I'm a 25 year old male. 2 things I care deeply about are:

1. Self improvement/personal development/self growth - Looking after myself now will improve the quality of my life in future.
2. Being determined to make the most money possible

However, over the last few years I've done a **lot** of travelling including visiting Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, The Philippines, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Albania, Macedonia and Turkey. I've also done a lot of research on visiting countries like Nicaragua, Guatemala, Colombia etc. I love travelling to explore different cultures, ways of life, and explore how other people live and go about their ways of life. I love the authentic non-touristic route and have met some amazing, genuinely lovely people from many developing and third world countries.

One thing I've found is that these people are extremely happy with their life that many of us here would find very basic. They often come from small villages with a simple way of life but a big community atmosphere and spirit within society.

Now back in the UK I've been brought up by my parents to get a good education, work extremely hard through school/college and then continue to work hard in my career now that I'm working full time. However I've realised I prefer to ""work to live"" as opposed to ""live to work"".

In a capitalist world we live in whereby I've been pushed hard by my family that a ""successful"" life is one that involves a good education, lots of money and a well paying job. I feel a bit like a 'letdown' to my parents for saying this but I've also thought to myself that I could happily live in one of these countries I listed above with very limited resources, internet etc and have a very happy life. Perhaps even more happy than in my existing job. I'm in 2 minds whether I continue to work hard or simply enjoy a much more simple life that I'd actually find far more fulfilling.

I'm interested in getting others perspectives on this?",travel

1188,traveling the world between expectations and reality,"warning, ridiculously long post aimed at helping a complete stranger, proceed only if you'r like the nicest person on earth or something :)

hi travelers, 

so before i start let me introduce myself, i am 25yo male, graduated 2 years ago, spent my first year after graduation working as an accountant but quit because of some inconveniences in the workplace and the low salary, i then spent my second year mainly studying German language but also doing some gigs for living, i even studied web development and tried to get a job with no luck, so the plan at that point was to study computer science in Germany because i am really into programming but without going into much details the plan didn't work out and here i am back to working as an accountant. 

so obviously since i am here traveling the world has been always one of my biggest dreams but sadly problems do exist, money is just a minor problem compared to the fact that i am holding an Egyptian passport, so basically no one trusts me to go abroad and then go back to the shithole i came from, which is something i definitely understand tbh.

so now that you know a little bit about me lemme get started and the way i am going to write this post is in form of questions and answers 

1- why do i want to travel as many countries as i can?

well, first because i am not dying having only seen one place, that's just not going to happen even if i have to cross the  Mediterranean swimming, i'll go for it and at least i will have a good one last adventure, second because you only live once and you gotta make it count and third i am so sick of trying my best to prove to the world that i deserve to live in a better place, the USA lottery, the job seeker visas, the point based immigration program, its all so stressing and just feels like people are being selected out of other millions to survive a sinking ship before it takes them way too deep, the whole thing is just so pathetic if you think about it, i just want to be careless for a while, i want to meet people who are not so stressed by work and life.

2- what do i have? what can i do?

A - i am good with Adobe photoshop and illustrator and i have a very acceptable design skills

C - i studied web development 

d - i know German (i can talk about basic stuff, no complex subjects, no politics or international crisis discussions :) )

e - i cant translate from Arabic to English, not so professionally tho and i really doubt anyone could ever pay me to do that

f- i am an accountant so obviously i do accounting stuff

g - i have around 7200 USD (1 EGP is equal to 16 USD and the average salary is 2500 EGP so...)

h - i can do anything an ""average"" person with no disabilities can do ( nothing that requires considerable physical strength for example) 

3- what are the problems ?

lemme see, there is money, as i only have small amount of money to start with so anywhere i go i will have to find a quick way to make money as soon as possible (can i ?), there is also visa problems, i can only travel to 52 countries around the world without visa or at least with visa on arrival, most of these countries are poor hence the free access (except Hong Kong i guess) but it's a good start nevertheless and i am going to take advantage of that, the third problem isn't really specific it's just that life is always throwing reality at you, will i ever be able to support myself traveling from place to place without a steady income ?

4 - so what do i want writing this post anyway ?

advice, maybe some of you guys did that or is doing that ? is it doable? can you travel so many places on budget? is there a skill that i can learn that will make my dream easier to achieve? 

i know about all the ways you find on the internet like staying at someone's house, traveling using public transportation ...etc but i want real people's experience, someone who did that and can tell how to do it and what kind of problems did they face

finally sorry for the long post, just felt like ranting a little, i really appreciate if you made it that far and sorry if my writing is a mess, i am not a gifted writer",travel

I was originally going to go detailed country by country but that's a lot of countries and too much to write, so I'll just give you the general overview. Warning, it is a bit long!

&amp;#x200B;

I studied abroad in Amman, Jordan from January to May. I'm still in college so it was part of a semester abroad thing. I had an amazing time it was a great experience. For anyone who is studying abroad, if you have the option to stay with a host family, **DO IT!** It's a great way to really get to know the culture, meet new people, and it turns out to be cheaper actually because you aren't playing for food. Plus, you usually get amazing home cooked meals out of it. Amman was very different from what I expected, but I had a great time. There's enough to do in Jordan to keep you occupied, and I highly suggest Wadi Rum, Petra, and Wadi Mujib. It's not the cheapest country, but you can definitely make it budget friendly. Since I was staying with a family and also studying, I don't have an accurate budget of what you'd need. Alcohol is expensive though, and public transportation is virtually non-existent. Cabs and Uber/Careem are the way to go. I felt completely safe as a female, but made sure always to go out at night with people I trusted. For anyone who is wondering, there are bars and clubs :)

&amp;#x200B;

While in Amman I went to Cairo, Beirut, and Cyprus.

* Cairo is very overwhelming as a white, female. I felt perfectly safe but pretty uncomfortable. Seeing the pyramids and Saqarra was phenomenal, and the Egyptian museum was amazing. I probably won't go back for a while, but I'm glad I did.
* I loved Beirut. I stayed with a friend, so she took me to places. The nightlife is amazing, it's right on the sea so pretty good weather. Byblos is really cool, and the people were very friendly. I think I stayed in the most expensive (safest) part of Beirut but it was reeeeally cheap coming from living in Boston. There is a stark contrast between where I stayed and other surrounding towns, and the remnants of the wars are very much there.
* Cyprus was okay. Never been to Greece, but it seems like a tiny Greece without all the major monuments and stuff. Fairly cheap, nightclubs were fun. Not really a beach person but it was nice to relax during spring break. Plus, you can get some really good food. Crossing over to the Turkish side was easy, and fairly uneventful. Not much to see, but a cool experience

&amp;#x200B;

After Amman, I started a two month backpacking trip across Europe. I went solo, with friends, and with family. I went to Hungary, Croatia, Montenegro, Spain, Portugal, and France. This was the first time I've been to all these countries.

* Hungary was amazing. I had such a good time. It's still pretty cheap even with all the backpackers. It's easy to get out of the city to visit smaller towns, and actually you should. Budapest can be done in three days, but it's nice to visit other parts of the country. I enjoyed the food, and highly suggest the free walking tours. I did the general, Jewish quarter, and communism one, and learned sooo much.
* In Croatia I went to Zagreb, Plitvice, Dubrovnik, Split, and Korcula. Zagreb was eh. Plitvice was the highlight of my trip. We went in May so it wasn't too crowded, but I can't imagine what it's like in July/August. Go on some of the back trails and don't just stick to the boardwalks. You can see some pretty amazing waterfalls from up top. I felt Dubrovnik to be pricey and overrated. Too touristy and it's just lost it's culture. I totally get why they do it, but doesn't appeal to me. Could easily be done in a day and a half, and then after that I wish I would have left. It's good place to do some excursions like kayaking, boating, etc, but it was really crowded and just not a lot. Go to War Photo Limited, it's a really cool photo gallery about the war. I much preferred Split and Korcula in Croatia.
* Was in Montenegro for three days and did Kotor, Budva, Mt. Lovcen and a couple hours is Perast. By this time, I was getting tired of old towns, so Kotor wasn't the best, but it's really pretty and walking up the fort wall was cool. I was with my sister who had just flown in so she was pretty tired and jetlagged, but there's a lot of cool nature hikes I would have loved to get to.
* Next was Spain. Since I didn't do this part of the planning, I didn't really know what to expect but I loved Spain. The food was amazing. So much good cheese, tapas, wine, beer, meat, and so much more. Madrid was easy to get around. The Alhambra was absolutely amazing. Book tickets well in advance, and I highly suggest a tour, even as someone who doesn't really like them. My favorite town was Seville. Just a relaxed vibe, and a lot to do. It is true though, the siesta is real as can be. Don't expect dinner until after 8:30, and most attractions don't open until 10. We did some other stops: Toledo, Ciudad Rodrigo, Cordoba, Salamanca. Spain isn't the cheapest place to travel anymore, but you can def do it on a budget. Since I was with my family, we stayed in Airbnb's so not really sure what the hostel prices are.
* Then off to Portugal. Faro, Lisbon, Porto, Aveiro, and then the Dao wine country. Tolls in Portugal are insane. Like 20 euros for one trip kinda insane. If you have the time and don't mind hills, do none toll roads. They are more scenic and  you can find cool things. We found a huge flea market driving back from Aveiro to Madrid. Portugal is cheaper than Spain by a little bit. I liked Spanish food better, but that's not to say Portugal had bad food. Lots of hills in Lisbon. Being on the ocean was nice, which meant really good fish. Lots of tourists, which isn't bad, but get ready if you go dead in the summer. We ended up being there during St Antony's festival which was so fun. Sardines, booze, parades. If you can go in June, they celebrate all their saints I think, and at night there's always something going on. Go to the Resistance Museum, you end up learning a lot about modern Portuguese history and the dictatorship.
* After returning the car, I went to France to meet up with a friend and her family. I did Marseille, Cassis, Aix-En-Provence, and Lyon. Lyon was my favorite. Amazing food, desserts, wine (which I'm not even really a fan of). The craft beer scene has hit, so I liked that. I was there during part of the heat wave, and it was **hot**. Most buildings are old so no AC, so pace yourself if you're there in the heat. France was the most expensive place I visited, but worth it. I was there during the WWC, so there were a lot of watch parties and events which was fun. The WW2 resistance museum was really well done, and learned a lot about Lyon and southern France during the war. I would love to go back to southern France when I have a bit more a budget.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've learned on this trip:

* Learn to say no. It's okay to want to do different things than the people you travel with. I'm one of those people that really can do anything, and will say ""oh I don't care, what do you want to do"", but it's good to have an idea on what you want to see and it's okay to go your separate ways during the day. Don't try to people please, but also don't be a jerk.
* Traveling with family as an older teen/adult is hard. You grow up traveling with them but you don't really plan the trip. Well when you're 21 and aren't shielded from arguments and different opinions it can be rough. I had a great time and am so glad they came to visit, and it worked out, but we haven't done a family vacation in over 10 years and haven't been out of the country together, so it was all new to us again.
* Solo travel is fine. You aren't going to die, you aren't going to go crazy from boredom. You can stay in a hostel to meet people. But honestly, I was okay with solo traveling and being by myself. A lot of times on this sub you read about people who had the best times of their life solo traveling, and meeting new people, and all that. But I was also okay with staying somewhere and just being by myself. I met people and maybe got a drink with them or hung out at the hostel with them, but I learned I much prefer to do the sightseeing by myself or with someone who I know their pace. For example some museums I want to spend three hours in, some I want to spend 30 minutes in. So I prefer to do that with people I know or by myself so i'm not thinking about being down with the other persons schedule. I learned I valued the sightseeing and experiences rather than meeting new people, but that's just me! But I did like meeting people over dinner etc. Just don't get too excited about meeting your bff solo traveling.
* Don't do things just because they are famous. I'm all for going to touristy and famous places, but just because all the sites say to go to the famous art museum doesn't mean you need to. I went to the Prado because it was free for me, but I wouldn't spend the money to go in. But also, don't ***not*** do things because ""everyone else does them."" That's a dumb way to live. Along with this, I grew very tired of paying to go into churches. I think cathedrals and basilicas and all that are insanely pretty and I'm glad I did the big ones, but just because there's one you can go into doesn't mean you need to if it's not your things. And when they take up your budget, it wasn't worth it to me. (Also, why is every church charging like 5 euros to get in? You're getting funded! I'll make the 1 euro donation but jeez).
* Same thing with old towns. The walls are cool, but they were in every town and city in Croatia.
* Transportation in Europe is amazing. Boston has trains that catch on fire. Rip.
* I really liked free walking tours. They gave me the lay of the land, and then I could always circle back after to something that interested me. Especially the theme ones. I tried to do one in every city that had one.
* I also learned I can't do the go out and wander thing. Maybe because it's where I grew up, but not having a set place to get to was not doing it for me. I liked having an end destination and then taking some time walking to that place, but just going out and ""wondering the streets"" (what many people say) I didn't like.
* While doing the long trip was great, I think my next trip will be about 2-3 weeks. I'm glad I tried out the backpacking for two months kinda thing, because it allowed me to learn that I like the shorter 2 week trips.
* Lastly, you have the money you saved for a reason. That's why it was a budget. There were times I didn't want to spend money, but later on realized I could. That budget shouldn't be the money you need to pay your bills. I had savings set aside for the trip, and all my other money was for the things I needed back home. That doesn't mean blow it all, and if you spend less than you budgeted that's great! But it's okay to spend money on tickets and experiences, if that's what you want to do. Not doing something you really want to do because it's $10 is a little ridiculous, at least in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad I went on this trip, and I want to thank this sub for giving me inspirations and suggestions! Happy travels!

I apologize in advance if I am not posting in the right subreddit. 
I am just writing to ask for your suggestions for a good resort in Cuba ( we are open about other countries in the Caribbean too! Let's see where this takes us. If it is for other places in the Caribbean I would say our cap is around 1400 CAD) 

It's a couples trip and our budget is no more than $1100pp (I hear that it is not worth it to spend more than that for Cuba) for a week in August.
I really care about the resort being clean, having clean rooms/sheets and it being safe. 
In terms of food, I'd prefer something decent but I am aware Cuba is not like Canada and my expectations are not of 5 star dining. I would like somewhere with fresh food that is good which won't get us sick. 
Also, somewhere that will have some sort of nightlife. My boyfriend and I would also like to party a bit at night/day

1238,Friend wants to spend too much on trip,"Hello everyone,

My friend and I have been saying that we want to travel for a while now. We were initially going to visit Vancouver but he springs up with Vegas. Well checked flights and hotels and surprisingly it is actually cheaper! So I said sure let's do Vegas and we decided we'd split the costs of things like travel, accommodation, food...etc. 

Now that we already booked Vegas he wants to rent a fancy sports car and add a bunch of other really expensive things to the trip and I just cannot afford it. He has a REALLY good paying job, like making 10K+ a month is not unusual for him meanwhile I'm going to school and currently seeking part time employment while I finish classes. So it's very easy for him to spend this money. I had originally put a budget cap of $600 for the 4 days, now I'm bumping it up to $1000 after realizing that it won't be nearly as cheap as I thought. But now he's starting to add a lot of things I can't afford to the itinerary and it's stressing me the hell out. 

I want to talk to him and tell him that I can't afford to go overboard but at the same time I don't want to ruin his (and mine) first trip to Vegas by limiting the things he can do and he won't do things without me, so it's not like I can tell him to do more expensive things alone. He keeps talking about ""going all out"" and ""yolo"". I feel like once we get there he's going to suggest very expensive restaurants and events...etc. We have another very cheap friend who's in an even better financial situation than me (who isn't going on this trip for obvious reasons), anyways that friend is always complaining about spending money (even small amounts) and my friend who I'm going with really hates it because he feels like he's being attacked for making good money (in a way, he really is, because that other friend always makes comments like ""Not all of us have money"" and ""Must be nice""...etc). I'm also worried he'll take it that way as well. 

Generally speaking, he's usually pretty level with me when it comes to spending money. By that I mean he doesn't tend to splurge beyond my means (or I should say he's been steadily going up in spending and it's starting to put a strain on me). 

So fine people of reddit, how do I approach this without being offensive and without ruining his trip. 

TL:DR Friend who is way richer than me wants to spend way more than I can afford on trip that was supposed to be cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have ordered [this backpack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1QQMHD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)  and plan on using it for all my gear  (cameras/lenses/laptop/gopros/batteries/etc... All is needed for work related things) and am currently looking for a 2nd bag that will house all my clothes/toiletries/etc... The  biggest goal I want to accomplish with this bag is that I never want to  have to check a bag. I currently have a small roller bag that is 20in x  13in x 7in similar to [this](https://media.kohlsimg.com/is/image/kohls/3339377_ALT?wid=500&amp;hei=500&amp;op_sharpen=1) but I'm not a fan of it. Ive been looking into [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FD5MLVB/?coliid=IUJJHLZFBC087&amp;colid=11WNXZQXAKY9K&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)  as I feel packing it would be the easiest for most efficient packing for me but not 100% that it will be okay on all flights as a carry on along with my backpack. The bag is measured 22x11x12 (45L) but is a soft side bag so it can be crunched down and squeezed into areas. It says it meets the requirements to fit in the sizer at the airports but airlines have different sizes (especially international right?). One review said ""*This is the first carry-on garment bag I have been able to use for week-long international travel.*"" But I don't know what international flight that was. One thing also to keep in mind with this bag is to fit my tripod as it wont fit into my backpack. Am I going to be in the clear with this or should I be worried about running into an issue at some point and just find a different bag? If so, what bags would you suggest to prevent any issues from coming up? I cant look up specific flights to check measurements individually as I have no 100% plan for where ill be going as it all will just be whatever happens happens kind of traveling around the world. Thus why I want to just find one from the start that should be okayed regardless of the flight.

&amp;#x200B;

When  it comes to packing: Ive read into several different styles from  Rolling clothes, Vacuum Bags, to packing cubes. Ive seen pros and cons  to all of them. Ive heard from long term travel to not use cubes because  they take up space that can always be used for something else. The  downfall to vacuum bags is that people say the lose air, also how to  remove the air the best. I have looked at ones with pumps that plug into  USB ports for power and ones with the hand pumps to remove air.

&amp;#x200B;

PS.  Ive see some checklists of things to pack X amount of shirts/ pants/ shorts/etc... and was wondering if anyone has some lists as well so I can look at them to compare them all and figure out what would be best for me and give me a rough idea of what I can and cant/ should and shouldn't bring.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  sure ill have more and more questions as time goes on while I get ready  and prepare for my trip around the world in a few months (if everything  goes as planned).

* Like - day hikes, kayaking, wine and wine tours/tasting, boutique shopping (or at least window shopping!), museums, warm weather, ocean/lake swimming, cafe culture

* Not fussed by - sports, historical sites and architecture, swimming pools and resorts, sitting on the beach or a sun-lounger all day, clubs.

* Definite no's - Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Rome, Florence, Nice

* I can't drive on the other side of the road.

I don't *really* mind being alone for my birthday, but I'd love to go somewhere where I could do some kind of special activity or group tour or fun thing on the day. Or least a scene that where there might be lots of other single/non-family travellers my age.

Is that possible? You can just walk in and order a couple glasses? Is there public transport to get around, or is everything within walking distance? Do these places have small bites, or would I need to hit up an actual restaurant for food? I'm open to any tips or recommendations for maximizing the day there.",travel

1259,Worried about travelling to Mumbai ?,"Hi there 
I wasn’t sure where to post this so I’ve started in this subreddit 
I’m hoping for some advice about an upcoming travel of mine.

Basically my girlfriend works as a makeup artist and so do I and recently since last year with a makeup school in Mumbai.
She’s been flown out there about 4 times now to Bandra West I believe it to be called to teach at the school.

All four times she’s gone I’ve had the offer to go but turned it down as I’m a very anxious traveller despite having been to Thailand once and America / New York And Las Vegas Los Angeles /  a few times a year and most of Europe .... Italy Germany France ect more Western Europe 
I travel frequently with my job and we usually travel together.

My issue here is lately in the last year or so my issues with my anxiety and stomach have been much worse
I currently am going through a process with my undiagnosed “ ibs “
Which has had me housebound for a majority of this year and in the times I have been travelling I’ve been having huge attacks 
Probably due to a mixture of anxiety and worry of not being near a public toilet and just because my stomach cannot digest anything :(

I’ve suffered with this for years I’m 21 almost 22 now and I’ve had it since I was about 12 years old
Usually if I can I turn down travel opportunities out of the uk / London
For my job unless I really have to go 

But my girlfriend has been pushing that I go to Mumbai for a year now and I finally gave in..
I know I probably sound crazy but I’m having a major panic about it.

The only other place I’ve been to is Thailand in Asia and although I loved it 
It wasn’t without it’s issues
I was sick about 3 or 4 times and some of them were when I wasn’t in reach of my hotel and send me into a panic. 

The problem for me is even with my medication of which I carry everywhere 
I can’t always control it 
It could be fine for days and then flare up.

I’m worried that Mumbai May be too much for me to handle and that it won’t have much easy access to toilets in public 

I’m staying in the taj lands end in Mumbai Bandra which yes I know is a gorgeous hotel
And generally other than a few days off we will be going around only the west Bandra area to the makeup school and occasionally out for dinner in the local area

But I know it wouldn’t be worth going to not see south mumbai and the other areas markets and things .. 

I guess I’m looking for some advice as I know from my girlfriend who never usually gets sick
She was sick there twice 
Even though she was in a 5* hotel

I’m stocked up on anti biotics and immodium and buscopan 
But I don’t want my anxiety to ruin this beautiful experience for me :(",travel

1270,Australian Bilateral Visa Waiver question for EU,"Hey there, I'm an Australian citizen that has an upcoming trip to Finland to see my partner planned in a few weeks. Originally it was going to fall under 90 days so didn't look too much into any other visa requirements as I am aware that we could stay in Schengen countries visa-free for 90 days.

But we've extended plans, and will be taking about 3-4 weeks holidays to countries including:Germany, The Netherlands, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Austria and Belgium. This was on top of our plans, meaning I'd then return to Finland for a couple of weeks before we head back to Canada.  
I then fell into a little panic that this would exceed the 90 days maximum - but just found out about the Australians Bilateral Visa Waiver program, where a bunch of these countries still have setup.

Kind of looking for clarification here - but to my understanding, this means in each of the countries listed [Here (scroll to the section)](https://smartraveller.gov.au/bulletins/pages/europe_schengen.aspx) I would get 90 days in EACH of these countries, that would be separate from my 90 days in other Schengen countries?

1271,"[taxi mafia problems - Bali] Unaware of taxi mafia, grabbed Bluebird taxi at echo beach who had just dropped passengers off, pulled out of taxi by locals at check-point, followed on motorbike by mafia","Hi all,

Myself [31, male, Australian] and my wife [28, female, Taiwanese] had just finished enjoying our day at Echo beach, Bali. We had caught a Bluebird (meter taxi) in, and in our naivety had no idea there was a taxi mafia running this beach.

On our way out, we walked down the main street and seen a Bluebird taxi drop off some customers and jumped in. We told him our address and off we went. We got to some apparent check-point on the road, those little bamboo huts where the dodgy-scam taxi drivers sit, and were suddenly blocked and surrounded by 5-6 local men and told to pull over.

The taxi driver opened his window and they exchanged words in a local language. He then turned to me and said he cannot take me. The man outside his window then yelled at me that there can be no metered taxis at this beach. I told the taxi driver to just drive (as it was clear ahead of us at that time) but he was scared. (I said 'meet us down the street' and he agreed, but he drove off never to return. In heinsight, he was terrified).

The local shithead walked to my side of the car and opened my door and said 'get out'. Myself and my wife got out and thought 'no fucking way in hell are we taking these asshole's taxis, fuck that', and walked off down the road.

We walked maybe 0.5 km down some side roads and then seen another Bluebird driving around. Flagged him down, as he was about to come to a stop he instead hastily sped off, and then suddenly a motorbike appeared with tattooed local riders (my wife later told me she recognized them, but was quiet at the time). We walked further up the street, and the same taxi turned around, flashed his lights at us and slowed, but then sped off again as the motorbike approached.

We then decided we had had enough of this and that it was getting potentially dangerous, so we ducked in a bar full of westerners and had a drink. Spoke to some of them, and they informed me of an app (Gojek) to use to get a taxi, and also seemed shocked at the situation. We figured that no way in hell did we want to use these dodgy guy's taxis, after-all if they are this dodgy, just how far will they go? We drank our drinks, ordered a (unmarked) Gojek car, and got the hell out of there.

Summary: We are fucking horrified that locals would actually pull two foreigners out of a taxi, and then follow us. This was extremely confrontational. I don't care if they have their own taxi mafia going, but stop the local taxis before they enter the beach area AND DO NOT INVOLVE OR INTIMIDATE FOREIGN TOURISTS.

This was our second time in Bali, and it will be our last. There have been other scams these past few weeks, and frankly, we are sick of it. Its always a battle here. This isn't how we wanted to spend our holidays.

Thank you for your time.

1279,How do I get an airline to cough up for a bad flight?,"Hey redditors, I have a question for you all. I recently went on what might be a recordbreakingly bad flight from American airlines. What should have been a 7-hour flight in fact took about 15 hours. How do I get the most goodwill compensation from the airline, being as how I missed basically the first day of my trip? Sorry for the formatting, as I am on mobile.

THE STORY:

I was traveling from LAX to the panhandle region of Florida. I had arrived at the airport well on time, and when boarding arrived... No plane. 

The gate crew got on the intercom and said, ""We are sorry for the delay, we have the plane, but it is not here at the gate. We are bringing it over here from the hangar. There is nothing wrong with the plane (she made sure to emphasize this twice), we are just making it over, and we will announce boarding soon."" No problem! Everything takes time. 

After some 20 minutes, they announced a gate change. Again, no prob. The plane arrived at the gate eventually and we didn't board. Another 10 minutes and they announced a mechanical problem. Things start to go off the rails at this point, as they made one or two announcements as to anticipated boarding time, then we heard nothing for 2 hours. We boarded two and a half hours late. By this time I have missed my connecting flight in Dallas. No attempt was made to have anyone waiting in Dallas to discuss rebooking flights, or even a sign pointing us to the customer service desk. They attempted to automatically rebook me on a flight that would have arrived 2 days later - if my girlfriend hadn't gotten online and rebooked it on the one flight going to my destination the same day. 

By any metric, this was a shitshow of a flight. Poor coordination to have the plane waiting, bad communication, extremely poor customer service, and maintenance issues, with no effort to soften the blow or issue compensation on site. when I asked the lady at the customer service desk about this, she referred me to the website. These actions and attitudes are worthy of a county fair lemonade stand, not a billion dollar major US carrier.

 I have nearly given up on American Airlines as a carrier entirely as a result of this and previous delays. I feel that since their performance was such at odds with the reasonable expectations of a major carrier, goodwill compensation is in order. My question is, how do I best get the most goodwill compensation from this airline?",travel
1280,Planning a 2 week trip through Central Mexico and then through Yucatan. Has anybody done this before?,"By 2 weeks, I mean 10 business days and 3 weekends, so 16 days total.

Quick rundown: I plan on starting in Guadalajara on the first Saturday. Get their early, be able to do somethings during the day, see some night life, leave from there on Tuesday or Wednesday. Make it to downtown Querétaro and stay their for the rest of the week. Enjoy Friday night at some of the local places that I know (Rhodesia Historico, Funky Mama), then make it to San Miguel de Allende on Saturday afternoon. Enjoy their nightlife (specifically trying to keep San Miguel on a Saturday because of how popular it is for night life).  Then I want to leave San Miguel on Sunday afternoon and make it to Mexico City a few hours later at the start of the evening. Then spend the next week of the trip in the Yucatan Peninsula to see the beautiful beaches and ruins. 

Entire Plan:
______________
**Phase One - Central Mexico by Bus** 

* *Guadalajara* - Saturday-Wednesday Afternoon. Get there early on Saturday and be able to see some nightlife for that one night. See some history and culture and food the the rest of the 4 days. 

* *Querétaro* - Wednesday Evening-Saturday Afternoon. I like the nightlife here so I'm using Friday night to visit Rhodesia Historico and Funky Mama. I would love to try to visit Tequisquiapan or Bernal within that time. I would also love to be able to hike the Cimatario National Park. Also, I'm spending more time here because I've been here, so I know the city and there's a lot of detailed things I'd love to try now that I've been here. A lot of good restaurants and foods I want to try here. 

* *San Miguel de Allende* - Saturday Evening-Sunday Evening. I didn't like how San Miguel felt isolated in the middle of nowhere, unlike how Queretaro was extremely huge and busy. But if I'm bringing a group, they're going to want to go somewhere fun on the weekends. 

* *Mexico City* - Sunday Evening-Wednesday Afternoon. I want to spend a decent chunk here because of all the history and culture here. Based on this schedule, I will be missing the nightlife in Mexico City I guess, but that's part of my plan to get a lot of the culture and food from this city. 

_________
**Phase Two - Yucatán Peninsula**

I will be flying from Mexico City to one of the local airports in the Yucatán Peninsula. I will be spending the rest of the trip there visiting small towns and ruins and relaxing on the beach for the end of the trip. 

I'm hoping to get the deep peninsula stuff done during the weekdays first so that we can spend the rest of the week + weekend enjoying the beach and bars that will be busy during the weekend. 

* *Valladolid* - Wednesday Evening-Friday Morning. We'll land in one of the airports, not sure which one yet, and then try to get to Vallodolid as soon as possible. Try some food, get some drinks on the first night and then find a hotel. The main thing close by without having to make another city stop is Chichén Itzá, we can spend all of Thursday morning and afternoon there, easily. Then maybe try to visit Cenote Dzitnup and Convent of San Bernardino of Siena on the way back to the coastal cities. Not worth leaving Thursday night, might as well gain a couple hours of nightlife and then drive back to Tulum on Friday morning.  

* *Tulum* - Friday Morning-Saturday Afternoon. Beach day, spend some time on the beautiful beaches, try some of the Caribbean Mexican food that I keep hearing about out of this region. Get some beers on the beach.

* *Playa Del Carmen* - Saturday Afternoon-Sunday. Last day of the trip! Enjoy some night life in a popular town where it might be good, especially on a Saturday. Spend the last day on the beach to relax from all the fast paced travel from the last few days. 

Leave Mexico on Sunday :(

Has anyone done something like this? We'll be going by bus for the longer distances, or by Ubers for the shorter distances. Are these cities good for nightlife?

There may be 4 people total. Are there other cities that I should maybe spend a day checking out along the way? Any tips for a large scale trip like this? Any specific restaurants or foods I should try in each of these cities? Is there something else that I maybe don't know about in Queretaro?

1290,Sept/Oct Chile Recommendations?,"Hi there, first time poster here.I’m traveling to Chile in a few months and am hoping to get any suggestions, recommendations or feedback on our plans.  We’ve asked around but have a hard time finding anyone who’s been to Chile.

The beginning part of the trip is already planned - we’ll be spending the first few days in Valpo (at the Winebox). From there we want to go to the Lake District and the Central Valley, and will have 6 to 7 days to cover these areas before we have to be back in Santiago. 

Knowing it will be late winter/early spring, we’re hoping to do some hiking, visit some wineries, and see the scenery.  We’re happy to splurge on nice accommodations and good food but otherwise mid range options are generally where we land. We prefer less crowded/less touristy areas. 

For anyone who lives in the area or has been, are there any must sees? Any places we should look into staying at (we like B&amp;B style accommodations), or recommendations for transport?  Would you suggest going somewhere else in Chile besides these two areas? 

Happy to provide more info too. Thanks!",travel

1292,Argentina and Chile in under a month,"Hey guys,

I need some advice by the South America aficionados here to make the most out of my travel. A few words about me: late twenties, male, European, don't speak any Spanish (but planning to do at least a beginners course before the trip), will be traveling alone. No fixed budget, working full time but not rich.

I want to do South America in mid November to December, probably 3 weeks plus a few days. I already narrowed it down to Argentina/Chile/(Bolivia maybe), because there's no way to do the entire continent in that time. I love hiking and natural wonders, but also like strolling through interesting cities. 

What I'm missing is 

a) What else to see than just Patagonia (already locked in), preferably something with a bit of contrast. Two ideas below, but would love any other suggestions.

b) a feeling for the distances and an understanding of how easy and fast traveling longer distances is (road quality, bus connections, flight frequency).

A very preliminary rough itinerary could look like this:

- 2 days in Buenos Aires, then fly to El Calafete
- 10 days hiking and sight seeing in this part of Patagonia (Glaciar Perito Moreno, Torres de Paine, Fitz Roy, ...), maybe with a rental car? Fly out to Salta or somewhere else around there.
- 9 days road trip (public transport?) for Atacama desert / El Tatio Geysirs / Bolivian salt flats (maybe just some of those plus something else that is closer by), then back to Buenos Aires and home. 

Adding a few days for the flights, that should be a good 3 weeks. A different itinerary could also be adding Tierra del Fuego and/or Peninsula Valdes and skipping the North-West partly or entirely.

I'd be happy to hear any ideas on where to go, what to do, and most importantly on ""this is impossible, don't do this"" when looking at my time constraint and distances. General advice on car rentals (4x4?), bus connections, border crossings, and whatever you feel is important is also highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot in advance!",travel
1293,"[xpost from solo travel] good destination for a surprise trip for my 50-year-old mom, alone?","Hi!  I posted this on a thread in solo travel, but haven't had any responses, so thought I'd try here:

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's 50th birthday is coming up, and my family wants to send her on an all-expense-paid trip for a week. She hasn't traveled much internationally (but very much wants to and absolutely loved a trip to Eastern Europe about 30 years ago), so it'd be the trip of a lifetime for her.  But I also want to make sure it's somewhere she feels safe traveling alone and that is easy to navigate (and friendly toward!) a solo, 50 year old american who only speaks English.  She's a big walker and I think would rather not drive in a foreign country.  She loves trying different foods, sightseeing, museums, etc.  She prefers cooler climates and doesn't really care about the beach/tropics.  She's also a little intimidated by big cities, having spent most of her life in a rural part of Western Washington.  (But I still think a city would be okay, as long as it was somewhere that felt safe on her own.)

&amp;#x200B;

Can you suggest a good destination for her? I was thinking New Zealand or Ireland maybe?  Anytime is okay, and the budget is no more than $4k, including airfare from the PNW.

The question is, with hard luggage you get the dimensions. Max allowable size without the 200 dollar fee is 62inches. With our duffle bags we measure 63 inches if it's filled to capacity. They are not meaning the height of the bag compresses and makes the total size about 60 inches. Does that matter? 

As far as I'm concerned if the luggage compresses that saves space and it shouldn't be measured as if there is stuff in it. But also don't want to pay 200 dollars per bag both ways.

1310,Canadians travelling to Cuba for the first time with layover in Mexico City and peanut allergy,"Hi /r/travel,


After some research, my partner and I have decided on Havana as a between semester trip this winter between Dec14th and Dec 23rd. We are salsa dancers, food lovers, fans of history &amp; culture and lovers of the shoreline and snorkeling. We are beyond excited at the prospect of this trip satiating bits of all the above. Our flight is through aeromexico has a 12hr layover in Mexico City on departure and 9h layover on return. We were hoping to turn the wait into day trips as we will be arriving in MEX 6am and 8am respectively.

We were hoping for affordable and most importantly safe guidance in leaving the airport to explore the authentic mexico city (within reason of course). I'm a big fan of food but am worried about logistically visiting central de abastos, etc. This brings me to my girlfriend's peanut allergy. We will have several laminated wallet cards in Spanish about her anaphylactic peanut allergy. How worried should we be in Mexico City and Havana respectively?


Finally, Our rough itinerary thus far in Havana is: Salsa lessons in Havana during the day, some socials at night, habana vieja, museums, malecon, vinales horse tours, air bnb experience snorkel tours and a day of churches and architecture walking.


For those that have been, is it advised to plan day trips to Vinales or trinidad from Havana or stay 1 or 2 nights at a casa particular instead? Will we have resistance or troubles trying to eat like locals using CUP vs CUC? Is renting a local tour guide for a day or two recommended? Our spanish is very basic at best. 


We are definitely open to more options for destinations, experiences or adventures so please fire away if you are a local or recent visitor!


Finally, I've read some conflicting information about gifting or donating to the Cuban people. We are not wealthy by any means but I do have 2016 era electronics like the G5 gathering dust. Are we contributing to an inequality or tourist problem by bringing tampons, shampoos, gift shop trinkets and electronics or is simply CUC tips the way the go?

1311,Best one-way car rental company / partner website in USA? Vegas - LA - San Francisco Trip,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for a bit of advice as I'm a bit confused by the dozen of car rental companies and partner/compare prices websites. I'm coming from Europe and I am planing a trip on the US West Coast. This is the itinerary for car rental:

1. 2 days in Las Vegas (TURO app) for visiting the Grand Canyon and exploring the city
2. 1 day for moving Las Vegas - Los Angeles **?**
3. 5 days in Los Angeles (TURO app) 
4. 1 day for moving Los Angeles - San Francisco **?**
5. 4 days in San Francisco (TURO app)

The recommendations I'm looking for are for one way trip between cities since for mostly everything else I will use TURO, really low prices and nice cars, but since they are personal possessions you can't leave it in another city so I'll have to use other companies for this.

* I am 23 years old with a 5 year old valid drivers licence so I will pay the 'young tax &lt;25yo' whatever the company but that's no issue
* I don't mind changing so many cars, I'll pick them up and leave them at the airport in each location at the same day

So, any positive experiences with any airport companies / websites that are user friendly and no hidden and decent costs? I liked how easy the Sixt app makes it but it's pretty expensive, e.g. 1 day renting a basic car between Vegas - LA is 220$ +. Now looking through those mentioned websites (e.g. [rentalcars.com](https://rentalcars.com), [easyrentcars.com](https://easyrentcars.com) ) I can see much better prices but there are so many companies and websites that I don't know which one should I trust with my money.

1317,"10-11 months travelling/working around Australia (working holiday visa), NZL, Canada, U.S., and South America - Any advice?","I've just graduated university in the U.K. and I'm working in London for the summer. I want to take a year out before I go into full-time employment, hopefully in September 2020, to travel/work and just get some life experience. I've saved around £4000 so far, and want to leave the U.K. with a minimum of £6000 by the end of September/early October, but will aim for £7000.

Just a side note, I can't *legally* drive as I don't have my license yet.  


This is a very general plan and I'm just looking for any advice/criticism etc. particularly regarding the working holiday visa (WHV) and the Americas.  


**Australia/New Zealand - 4-6 months**

I'm being optimistic and hoping I will be able to almost break-even whilst in Australia as I won't need to pay for accomodation (friends around the country, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide) and will be able to find a job (mines, farms, pub/bar work etc). I've heard of quite a few people actually making a profit whilst on the WHV. I'll probably spend the majority of my time in Australia, around 5-6 months, starting in October.

&amp;#x200B;

I would head out to NZL around December time (have some family there) and just do some fun touristy things (bungee jump, white water rafting etc.) but I'd only spend a couple weeks there and treat it more of a holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

**Canada - 1.5 months (approx)**

I'll be doing a homestay in Canada whilst playing rugby for a club in Ontario for around 6 weeks, so I don't expect to spend a great deal. I'm also going to try and work part-time. I won't be doing too much travelling during this period as I'm mainly going there to play rugby.   


**U.S. - 0-14 days (?)**

After finishing up in Ontario, I'd love to see a bit of the U.S., but I'm not sure how feasible it is. This is where my plan is a bit muddled.

I would finish in Canada around mid-late May/ early-June time and I've got a couple options:

1. Meet my mate in North Carolina and head straight down to South America with him and virtually not do any of the U.S.
2. Meet him in Florida and spend a week there going to theme parks, and just having a bit of fun before heading to South America
3. Travel down the East Coast for around 2 weeks, staying at friend's places before meeting my mate and travelling down to South America
4. 2 week long road trip across the states (?) - not sure if I'll have enough time/money for this
5. Fly from Canada and meet my mate in South America and just skip the U.S. completely
6. Other options??

&amp;#x200B;

**South America - 2 months (?)**

Regarding South America, I'd probably stick towards the West. I really want to go to Bolivia and see the salt planes, hike in Chile, go to Peru and see Machu Picchu, and go along the Amazon river. I'd probably start in Chile (?) as it makes sense geographically, and move my way up through each place either via bus or plane.

&amp;#x200B;

**Central America?**

It would be very cool to head to Mexico, Belize and other parts of Central America but once again, not sure how feasible it would be as I would want to return to the UK for mid-August

1328,Anxiety about Japanese culture,"Hi /r/travel, I'm travelling with a group of friends to Japan in 13 days (18th of July) and have just started getting nervous about the culture there (This is my first time going to Japan so I'm not sure what to expect). I have a few questions to ask people who hopefully have more experience travelling [to Japan] than me, more for my own peace of mind than anything.

1) I've learned a small amount of hiragana but have never seriously tried to learn much Japanese. Is it worth trying to really study/learn the language in the 13 days before I leave? I consider myself reasonably adept at learning languages but I also know learning the characters itself is a massive task and I know I wouldn't get very far anyway, but maybe it would help some. One of my friends speaks a fair amount of Japanese so I'm not concerned for my ability to navigate, but more about coming off as rude, which leads into my next question.

2) We're travelling in a group of 4, three of whom are from China while I'm very white (blond hair/blue eyes), and I'm a little self conscious about sticking out and I'm not sure what to expect, since I've heard Japan can be slightly xenophobic (although I've heard especially xenophobic to non-Japanese Asians so I'm not sure). Is there anything I should do to be more culturally conscious so I don't offend anyone or come off as some rude white westerner?

Maybe my getting nervous isn't making a reddit post about but some information might make me feel better. My main two concerns are the language and not making a fool of myself, as above. Also I'm sorry if I've said something offensive; I'm just trying to learn and don't want to be rude.",travel

1331,"What is the point of travel insurance, if they ""we will not pay for"" pretty much anything, is this all a rip off that nobody talks about?","Hi all,
After going over 4 different insurance companies, reading their 50-page long policy booklet.

I came to a conclusion, what is the point of buying travel insurance anyway? 

One example is: ""We will not pay for"": From **Zurich**
(Trip delay and missed departure)The claim that is for

1. a) the withdrawal of an aircraft, cross-channel train or sea vessel from
service (temporarily or permanently) on the recommendation or order of any
government, civil aviation authority, port authority, rail authority or similar
authority in any country;
1. b) closure of airspace;
1. c) closure of your scheduled point of departure; and/or
1. d) storm or severe snowfall,
unless section 13 ‘Catastrophe, natural disaster and airspace closure’ is shown in
your statement of insurance, where cover will apply as set out in that section
of your policy.
1. Any claim if your delay in getting to the departure point was caused by industrial
action which started or was announced before you bought the travel tickets or got
confirmation of your booking.
1. Any claim which is the result of any form of industrial action, strike or failure of public
transport announced on television, news bulletins or in the media in the UK before
you booked a trip and bought this insurance.
1.  Any claim which is the result of your private car not being fully roadworthy before
breaking down on the way to your departure point.
1.  Any claim which is the result of you missing your departure because of heavy traffic 

**So my question is what tf it does cover? Wouldn't it be simpler for them to just say ""we cover these situations and other than that is a no""**

**Another example** for some other policy ""apparently really good "" **Travelex**
They cover for Accidental Death and Dismemberment:
We will not cover for : Loss caused by or resulting directly or indirectly from sickness or disease of any kind;stroke or cerebrovascular accident or event; cardiovascular accident or event; myocardial infarction or heart attack; coronary thrombosis; aneurysm.

* So another question what accidental death it does cover ?? If meteorite falls on me or car hit me ? (it might say something about car in some other section that it excudes it aswell) So basically i get covered for accidental death meaning if i get sickness or disease going abroad i will be covered &gt;&gt; nope your wrong...

* Seems like complete bs to me, i dont know maybe you guys tell me something which insurance do you guys use and do you also spend days before trip reading policies because they are so complicated and so hard to read that probably it covers all but when you get deeper into policy it covers nothing.

Or **Allianz**, it was simplest most logical policy booklet i read i think, all clear and layout nicely was happy last page all good finally will buy insurance... just to find out right at the very end last page a surprise "" we are covering only these airlines "" boom just like 10 major airlines, no china southern, no air Asia, no philipine airlines, just big major ones american, Norwegian, British etc are you guys serious ??

Do you really buy insurance, is it really worth it, what does it cover tho if from what i read it covers nothing, is it complete bs rip off people or its actually useful?

Tell me your opinion guys on travel insurance and if you use which do you use and why ?

Thanks for help !",travel

I am a traveler with my heart and soul. And I love that flying is affordable af.  You can now fly from Europe to Bangkok and back for 1/5th of your monthly salary. Or if you have a ryan air deal you can fly for the price of a fancy dinner from North to South Europe. 

If there were no side effects, I think I would travel every other day. But by crossing continents you are simultaneously melting off the equivalent of [3sqm+ ice in the arctics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/11/03/heres-how-much-of-the-arctic-youre-personally-responsible-for-melting/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7c1d705e1e0dsomething) though. And that to me means the pricing is not right. 

A climate tax could be used to neutralize the negative effect flying has by planting forests or similar projects that improve sustainablility.

Cartagena

Despite most people saying it's impossible to visit Switzerland on a budget, I think I might've organized a fairly reasonable itinerary.

**Itinerary**

Day 1: Land in Zurich at 8am. Explore the city for a little bit (I hear there's not much to see). Take the train to Lucerne at ~3pm and explore the city and surroundings. Sleep at the Lucerne campsite.

Day 2: Leave Lucerne early and take the train to Geneva, then take a bus to Chamonix, France. Do nature stuff there. Sleep at Chamonix campsite. 

Day 3: Do more nature stuff in Chamonix, watch the finals of the Lead Climbing World Cup in Chamonix at night. Sleep at Chamonix campsite.

Day 4: Leave Chamonix, head to Montreux. Explore the city and surroundings. Sleep at Montreux riviera campsite

Day 5: Leave Montreux, visit relatives in a small town East of Montreux. Spend the night there.

Day 6: Head to Bern, explore the city and surroundings. Sleep in a campsite outside the city.

Day 7: Head to Interlaken, explore the town and surroundings. Sleep in a campsite there.

Day 8: Visit Lauterbrunnen, explore the town and surroundings. Sleep either there or in Interlaken.

Day 9: Head to Zermatt. Explore town and surroundings. Camp there.

Day 10: Take the Glacier Express from Zermatt to St Moritz, Sleep in a campsite there. This one I'm doubtful of. I don't think I want to do the full 8 hours on the train if all I want to really see is the Landwasser Viaduct.

Day 11: Take a train to Linthal, hike a trail there to a lake up in the mountains where I'm planning on wild camping for the night (from what I've researched, it's a myth that there's a blanket ban on wild camping in Switzerland. It's legal if you only stay for one night and do it above the treeline).

Day 12: Head back to Zurich (still figuring out what I can do this day, all I know for sure is I need to sleep in Zurich to make it to my flight early the next day.

Day 13: Fly out at 7:30am.

**Budgeting**

Swiss Travel Pass Youth - 15 days = 445 USD
I'm going to be moving around *a lot*, so I'll be getting good value of out of the travel pass. This pass also includes access to most cable cars and museums.

Food= 15 USD x 12 days = 180 USD
I'll probably be eating a lot of ramen, oatmeal, eggs, bread with nutella, and maybe I'll get fancy and cook a burger a couple of times. This would usually be ~5-8 USD per day in a normal country, but because it's Switzerland I'll double it. Eating like this cost me ~10 USD per day in Iceland, also a very expensive country. This number might go a bit higher depending on how much beer I drink while I'm there. 

Lodging in Switzerland = 20 USD x 9 nights = 180 USD
Campsites seem to range from 13 USD to 25 USD per night. I'm erring on the safe side with 20 USD per night. I'm also not counting the one night I stay with relatives here, and the one night wild camping.

Lodging in Chamonix = 13 USD x 2 nights = 26 USD

**Total** = 831 USD or 63 USD per day.


Expenses I may not have considered yet: SIM card, reservation for Glacier Express, bus from Geneva to Chamonix and back. 

Thanks to the Travel Pass, I get a flexibility with where I want to be and when, so this itinerary is 100% subject to change and would vary depending on if I meet people I like and/or find new interesting plans. Any thoughts and comments are appreciated!!",travel

1360,One week in Croatia advice/suggestions,"Hey all

So I'm planning on going to Croata for one week from 22nd July to 29th July. Although I originally planned to start my trip from Zagreb, I found a more convinient and cheaper back and forth flight to and from Split, which would arrive around 11 am on 22nd, and would be departing from Split 11 am local time on the 29th. Thus I won't be visiting the capital, and that has messed up my plans a bit. 

So far I'm certain on 2 days in Split and 2 days in Dubrovnik. That would leave me with 3 additional days, but I'm unsure how to fill that time. 

1) Could I visit Hvar, Korcula and Krka waterfalls within 3 days?

2) Or perhaps extra days in Split, and do some daytrips from there (Plitvice, Trogir, island tours?)

3) Or perhaps something else altogether?

I (25M) will be traveling with my mother (60), so I would like to find a ""best of both worlds"" compromise. Although I might check out local nightlife, she definitely won't do that, so perhaps some more relaxing ideas are welcome. 

Intrests: historical sites, architecture, nature, beaches/sunbathing, good food/wine/local specialities, (anything else not too extreme).

Another question I have concerns getting to Dubrovnik. 

1) Being an EU citizen, can I cross the border with just my ID-card/passport? I've read up on it and got the impression that there would be no need for a visa or such.

2) Should I go by bus, rent a car, or over sea (from Split)?

I was wondering if anyone has bought one of these passes if they can tell me what they think. I’m definitely going to do a boat tour either Maid of the Mist or Hornblower and also do a behind the Falls tour.

1419,India Visa Help: US citizen applying for 10 year visa (Plus continuing to SEAsia),"Hello all,
This will be my first time traveling out of the US other than some minor resort excursions as a kid and I could use some advice. It seems like i decided to jump off the deep end with this one...

I will be traveling to India and Southeast Asia between October 2019 and April 2020. I have the first 5 weeks planned — I’m sitting a 10 day meditation course and then going on a 3 week pilgrimage to sacred sites in Northern India and Nepal. Beyond that, I’d like to continue traveling in India  for about a month before continuing on to Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and maybe Vietnam? It all really depends on how much I’m able to save up before leaving and how much I enjoy prolonged international travel. Maybe I’ll want to come home after 3 months, maybe I’ll get to April and want to keep going (I’m thinking of applying for the Australia/New Zealand under 30 work visa and heading out there after I’m done in SEAsia). For reference, I’ve been living in my Subaru Outback for the last year traveling around the West Coast working and exploring, so I have at least dipped my toes into minimal/itinerant living.

I am looking at applying for the Indian 10 year multi entry visa for US citizens that allows you to stay for 6 months at a stretch (ill want to have the option to be in India for longer than 2 months so the tourist EVisa wont work).

I have booked a multi city flight into New Delhi 10/11/2019, and out of Bangkok 4/1/2020. I am not certain that I will actually board the 2nd leg of that flight, but it was a cheap way to book and gives me plenty of breathing room to travel freely.

So, for the India Visa I know I need to submit an itinerary with my application that covers entry place, places I’ll be visiting in sequence, and exit place. I know when I’ll be entering and what I’ll be doing for the first 5 weeks, but beyond that I was hoping to leave it largely up in the air. How closely does my itinerary need to resemble where I really end up? Can I just pick a likely point/date of exit or must this be accurate? 

Also, I have heard that I need to be able to display my continuing travel plans upon entering India, otherwise I may be denied entry to the country altogether. Will my return flight from Bangkok to the US in April qualify, or do I need to book a flight out of India inside the 6 month window of my visa? Does this flight need to match what my Visa application itinerary states?

Am I crazy for trying to figure this all out without a travel agent?

Any additional travel advice/tips you’d like to share about the countries I’ve mentioned? Any advice on Visas and border crossings (I haven’t even started looking into this for countries other than India)?

Thanks so much for any help, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with the planning at the moment. Hoping 3 months is enough time to plan this whole thing out.",travel

The website is a bit vague... it advertises unlimited travel by train, bus, and boat, as well as panoramic railways and funiculars. However I think this only applies to transit operated by SBB CFF FFS. Does anyone know if it covers cable cars and gondolas from, say, Mürren to Gimmelwald? Or Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp? Or is there a discount with these routes, since they're likely operated by a different company?

A friend of mine has US citizenship and Canadian citizenship; the only form of ID he has is his US ID card. His Canadian driver's license is expired and his passport is lost.

1. Does he need a Canadian passport to book his ticket?

1431,"I’m going on my annual holiday to Spain soon, and looking at getting a travel card, any recommendations or advice on using one? Also any security tips for home while I’m not there?","TLDR is the question, not much else to add except that I’m in the UK and renting a room (I’m a lodger) so the security isn’t all over my house, mostly just for my room.

Longer version: I tend to go away every year, I’m fairly lucky that my grandparents and Aunt brought villas in Spain years ago so me and my cousin (who I’m traveling with) have places to stay on holiday, all our flights are sorted out as she works for an airline and did all of that stuff for me, I just need to pack and sort my travel money.

Normally when I travel there I only stay for 4-7 days and don’t go to the beach (villa is opposite a private pool) so having a travel card isn’t really something I need as I pay cash everywhere. This time though I’m actually going out there for 2 weeks and my cousin loves the beach so we’ll be going there a lot, I’m planning on taking half my money in cash (for markets and small purchases) and half on a travel card (for any larger purchases, general shopping and the beach). I know nothing about travel cards, except that they work like a bank card that you top up. So if I could have some recommendations for them, and people’s personal experiences with using them that would be great.

Home wise, I’m lodging in a house with a couple and their brother, so I just wanna make sure that my room isn’t messed around with, I’m having a huge tidy up before I go anyway and I literally have nothing valuable at all (the most expensive thing I own is an old laptop), and I’m switching off all my plugs before I go away so there’s no reason to rent go in my room. I grew up sharing a house with 4 siblings so I just don’t really like leaving my stuff alone as I’m always scared people are gonna touch it.",travel

* I have a fairly standard Canon DSLR battery and double A rechargeable batteries for my flash / slaves. The website says that all batteries must be installed. I assume that means that it's okay to leave the batteries in the gear? In my head, \*installed\* makes me think of something that can't be removed--hence my confusion.
* Above all, the carry on size requirements are really confusing. It says that the maximum size is 9 x 14 x 22 inches.  From what I understand, this is pretty standard. However, they also say that  ""This measurement includes wheels, pockets, handles and decorations. The carry-on bag must fit in the overhead compartment."" With a camera *bag* this is a little confusing because the pockets of air between the straps and the ground can create at least an inch of width, especially if the left and right straps are crossed underneath the bag. The product dimensions on Amazon and BH Photo, however, show the exterior to be within the limits - 22 x 10.5 x 8"" (55.9 x 26.7 x 20.3cm). Should I expect problems with this bag?

- a few days to explore Edinburgh
- a few days in the Highlands or an Isle (most popular of course being Isle of Skye)
- a few days in Glasgow

1479,A Travel Guide to Romania. The Urban Version,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I’m posting this here and cross-posting it with /r/Romania as I’ve seen tons of tourists roaming through Bucharest, among many other places in Romania.   


Some of you might think about getting a small city break, others might not know about Bucharest, but are tired that all the major attractions are already overcrowded and don’t know where to go.

So come to Romania. We’re okay, I promise.

This post might be subjective as it’s my point of view. But I hope other redditors will come with good info. You can read a wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/wiki/travel/#wiki_a_basic_travel_guide_to_romania), but it was last updated in March 2018.

I will post info here as I would like to see it when I first come to a new place. 

A short brief about me just to get an idea. Male, going on 30, urban professional, kinda into the whole alternative-underground-artsy thing. You know the type. I’m pretty urbanized myself, so I prefer to have a 4G network and decent services wherever I go.

So, first things first.

* Romania is in Eastern Europe and it’s pretty amazing. Still undiscovered by tourists, you can roam around the country and the people will be nice and eager to help. We like tourists, you’re cool. Before you leave, check the weather. As it’s July now, the entire country is pretty hot. Bucharest is hotter than hell now, as there is no wind, lots of buildings and asphalt. Don’t sit in the sun during the day and be a Hydro Homie. 
* When you arrive at the Henry Coanda Airport you can order an Uber, Bolt (local version of Uber), taxis through the StarTaxi and Clever taxi app or directly at the entrance. A ride from the airport to the city center shouldn’t cost more than $10-$15 (40-50 lei). 
* Don’t change a lot of money at the airport. Just like in any other country, the rates are crap.
* Just as a brief overview, $1 is about 4 lei, 1 euro is about 5 lei. 
* Never (like never, never) get a cab from the side of the road. They’re not dangerous or anything, but some of them might try to haggle over the price of the ride and you don't need that in your life.
* If you’re from the EU, you can use your own phone sim card. If you’re from outside of the EU, just buy a pre-paid sim. It costs about $5 and you’ll pretty much have unlimited internet. I would recommend Vodafone as it has the best connection. 
* There are tons of hotels, hostels, AirBnb’s and so on. Just pick one that doesn’t look shady.
* Speaking of shady. We’re not shady. Bucharest is one of the safest cities in Europe. We rarely have violent crimes, people don’t chase you with knives on the street (what’s up London? Still stabbing?) You can walk around the city at night without having to be afraid of being mugged. Just stay out of the rough neighborhoods and you’ll be all right. Avoid Ferentari, Rahova, and Giulesti. These are ghettos and you don’t have anything to see there. The most annoying people are beggars, but they just yap around aggressively, but won’t do anything. Just don’t look too touristy and you’ll go unnoticed.
* Most of the people under 40 (and many above that age) are fluent in English and probably another European language. They’ll happily help you in case you’re lost or need directions. 
* Use the subway. Our subway system is pretty good and clean. Take buses and trams only if you feel adventurous.
* During daytime, you can take a couple of walking tours across Bucharest. There are both free and paid tours that cover pretty much everything. From the history of the city, its’ Communist era, nightlife, underground life and so on. Just google it. I would recommend you do that in the first days to get accustomed to the city. As I mentioned before, Bucharest has more to offer than it looks. 
* If you want to see the Palace of the Parliament, the MNAC (National Museum of Contemporary Art) has a terrace on the top floor. It’s relatively unknown, as many locals don’t know about it. A beer is about 7-10 lei, wine is about 15 lei. Don’t go there during mid-day. It is fucking hot.
* Gradina cu Filme is also a great place. Pretty quiet and cozy, is great for a beer or two. Which by the way costs about 8 lei. 
* During the evening you can visit the Unirii Fountain. It was recently renovated and it offers quite a show. Usually, the streets are closed around them during the weekends and they have light &amp; music shows 2 or 3 times a night. You can find some cool videos on YouTube. 
* Food. You can find everything, everywhere, at any hour. Seriously. If you want to feel the local vibe, try a shaworma or some mici. The best mici are at Obor (can’t say for sure, not a big fan myself).
* Nightlife. Wooh, geez. A lot of it, everywhere, until morning. It depends on what you like. Saturdays are the best, even though you can find tons of people during weeknights too. I would suggest you take a walk through the Old Town to see the vibe, but that place’s nasty. All the kitsch of Bucharest is gathered in one place. But I would recommend Mojo though, or other clubs/bars that are not on the main streets of the Old Town. Do a small research before. I usually go Control, Expirat, Apollo111 or Eden. Can’t say the music is great, but you will find a lot of interesting people to chat with. During the peak nights (Fridays and Saturdays) there are a lot of tourists. 
* The drinks in pubs and clubs are fairly priced. The beer costs from 7 lei and cocktails about 15-25 lei.
* I know our alcohol is cheap, but don’t forget to hydrate. Don’t ruin your evening and the day after. 
* Let’s talk about drugs. Recreational ones are fairly easy to find, but don’t get caught. Romania still has zero tolerance on drugs and you don’t want to spend the rest of your night in a police station. Even though you can get by with a small “fine” for good ol’ 420.
* Since it’s summertime, you can go visit the seaside. The beaches are at a 2-3 hour drive from Bucharest. Please take the train (private ones, not the onest from CFR), or go with a local. You need to be from around here to know how to drive in Romania. If you still decide to drive, take the highway. Avoid the rush hours as the road will be very entertaining, but not in a pleasant way.
* You can go either to Mamaia (lots of various clubs, more on the Techno, Minimal, something something scene), or go to Vama Veche. Vama Veche is more of the hippy, creative, alternative place. A couple of rock bars, lots of hipsterish places for yuppies. The vibe is pretty great both during the day and by night. Go there on weekends to get the best parties. 
* You can find tons of hotels or camping sites in Vama Veche. I can recommend Sandalandala. You can rent a tent/sleeping bag/ mattress there and interact with people. Their bathrooms and showers are decent, food is not bad (not excellent either, but hey - Vama is made for drinking, not fine dining). Prices are okay.
* Vama is all about food and having fun. The beaches are pretty crappy, so don’t expect to have spectacular views. But the parties tho’. Do wait to see the sunrise on the beach. It’s sort of a local tradition. 
* During the day you can sit at the beach and just enjoy a drink or two. A sunbed starts from about 20 lei a day.

I hope you’ll find this useful.

We will also be travelling outside the city on a day or two and I am 99% sure this card is accepted on everything but again pricing is elusive.

1482,Is Hotwire.com trustworthy?,"I was about to book a hotel on Hotwire.com but did a quick Google search first and found some not-so-favorable reveiws of their services. However, most of them revolved around the hotel not having their reservation when they arrived and I would think as long as I call to confirm that the hotel has my reservation ahead of time that wouldn't be an issue. The other issue I kept reading about is Hotwire placing people in hotels that aren't as many stars as they were promised, not in the right area, etc. But those were for completely blind bookings and the deal I am wanting to book guarantees that I will be placed in one of four hotels and they are all satisfactory to me. So I am wondering if there are other issues with hotwire.com that should make me reconsider using them? If it's legit it will save me $100+. Thank you!",travel
1483,Recommend me a shoe for city walking!,"Female, 5'1, 60kgs. 

I can't tell if it's just me but... I think I just have some really bad luck with shoes or I'm just not doing/considering something right. I generally do a lot of walking whenever I travel and have worn various, I would say pretty reputable shoes, however, I always get tired in them waay sooner than I expect and it's just such a bummer to have the energy to still keep on exploring but your feet are holding you back, ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I thought I'd list down the shoes I have tried walking/travelling with in the past and how they have fared for me (in no particular order). Curious to find out of anybody else have the same experience with some of these shoes and what recommendations for shoes you have. I don't specifically have a budget right now, I'm just really looking to get me the pair of shoes I know I will love and will bring me to more places! Here goes: -

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Skechers GoWalk3 Unfold** \- So far, these shoes have been the most comfortable for me but I have some qualms with its durability. After a 2 weeks Euro trip of mostly walking they were pretty flat/compressed. I thought, ""ok yea what do you expect, you did a lot of walking of course they're compressed"" but after that, they were just never the same. They just felt like flats to me. Not long after they just started to reek, and I had to wash them thrice and even threw it into a super hot dryer and baked it in my car parked under the hot sun for a solid 2 weeks to get the stink off for my trip to Japan in winter. They were decent smelling but damn, after like 2 days of walking it just reeked again and I realized maybe it's just the whole memory foam thing and inability to pull out the soles. Anyway, it was sad to see those shoes go- I left them in Vietnam after wanting to give it a chance one last time but they were too far gone and I guess I am just taken aback by its lack of durability to hold up 2 weeks worth of walking (and the SMELL).
2. **Nike Roshe One** \- I wouldn't say I knew much about sneakers then but I had plenty of friends swearing their lives upon these shoes and how comfortable they are. It was like a no brainer for me to get them but was fairly disappointed with these - I actually had to double check if they were originals after wearing them for a few months because I thought to myself, ""this *CAN'T* be the shoe everyone's raving about right!?"" I brought them to Singapore and almost instantly regretted it. I went to get Scholl insoles for them and plugged them right in. They were just ok after but it kind of felt like it defeated the purpose of getting these pair of shoes specifically in the first place. I truly learned the importance of an arch support from these pair of shoes. 
3. **Adidas Pureboost X -** I've heard greeaat things about the boosts and thought I'd give it a go! Finally! Friggin shoes with an emphasis on the arch support! Must be a winner, right!? But eh, I just came back from Singapore over the weekend and they tired me out fairly quickly as well. I wouldn't even say I did much walking this time even. I went to Skechers to try out the new GoWalks and thought I would just revert back to those but after having some form of arch support on the boosts, comparatively, the boosts still felt better so it didn't make sense for me to fork out the cash for new GoWalks. Today is a Wednesday and my feet still hurt from just the little bit of walking I did over the weekend.
4. **Converse All Star Low Top -** I just wanted a casual pair of black shoes I didn't plan to walk in much during a recent trip to Vietnam because I knew I was going to be on a bike most of the time so I really didn't expect to do much walking at all. However from whatever little walking I did eg. walking to a restaurant less than 1km away to get dinner, quick walkaround a small town for a break etc really wore my feet out. I even just reverted to some cheap Vietnamese sandals and those felt better-ish? How?!

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm heading to London for 3 weeks and I just plan to do lots of walking but I can't even begin to think of what shoes to even bring at this point in time given my experience. I've done some research and was considering looking into getting either Allbirds, New Balances, Merrells or really splurging that cash on Ultraboosts (...?) I will have a bigger variety &amp; accessibility to more brands in the UK (I've never even heard of Allbirds up til today - I'm from Malaysia) so it'll be a great opportunity to get one when I'm there. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Any recommendations or tips you guys have would be greatly appreciated. I'm thinking what I need is a light, durable shoe with good arch support and isn't going to break anyone's bank.

We are both college students and this will be our grad trip. I have done much research and would like some feedback on what to add or remove.

Past travel experiences: Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, NYC, Mexico. Various cruises to Caribbean islands/countries. 
 
Budget: Undecided yet but we prefer comfort, eating out for dinner (no wine) and the occasional splurge.

 Priorities: History, Museum, Nature, Aesthetics, Want to see the ""BIG SIGHTS"" of Europe. We also like partying but nightlife is not a big deal to us.

Wengen (Swiss Alps) - 6 days 

Vienna - 5 days

Manchester - 1 day (United fan here....gotta see Old Trafford)

London - 8 days

Paris- 7 days

Yes, the itinerary is ambitious but I did try to allocate at least 5 days for all major cities. Is there any place I should take out or add? Perhaps London or Paris is too long? Wengen/Skye also seems a bit long but both sites are a bitch to travel into and out of. Another thing to add is that we have to start in Barcelona (SO heading there first with her family) and end in Paris (anniversary)...everything else is fair game.",travel

For anyone who has travelled S/E Asia and Bali (where we are now) you would have heard about the scary sicknesses you can get. I need some advice. About 2 weeks ago she was bit by a wild cat. We immediately went and followed through with the rabies vaccines. She got 2 shots right away and was scheduled for a third in a couple weeks. We went up to the north of bali, Lovina. Took us a while to find a place to give her the shot but we did it. Literally the day after she was experiencing terrible muscle pain, headaches (pain behind the eyes), and she was really hot. I immediately did a bit of searching and thought that it was a reaction to the shot. We rode out the day and I gave her some tylenol and paracetamol but it didn't seem to work very well so we decided to go to the hospital in Singaraja. The doctor took her vitals and weirdly enough she didn't have a fever. The doctor said the shot wasn't the culprit because the was fine with the first 2. Curious what this bug was we got a blood test. It came back normal. I questioned the doctor about possible dengue and she said that the white blood cells were at normal level so if the symptoms get worse to come back and get another test. We got some pills and went home. After the pills she felt a whole lot better in the morning. Almost back to normal, just tired. Now about 3 days have gone by and the headaches and muscle pain is gone but she is exhausted and nauseous all the time. My question is has anyone experienced something similar and should we ride it out or go get some more tests at a clinic. I think I will take her to a clinic today, but I thought maybe the symptoms were better. Either way please feel free to share any experience or advice on this. Thanks!

I'm trying to make sure my friends and I all get on the same plane. A friend &amp; her sister are about to book the one on the right, which only has two tickets left. If I book the itinerary on the left, is it the same return flight?

I’m a Portuguese national living in Brasil and I want to visit Montreal in late august.
The most affordable flights all have a connection in the US. I already both the ESTA to enter the US for the connection and the eTA to enter Canada, however, US immigration states that I can only enter with VWP signatory carriers.
 I checked the list before booking anything and most of the flights are sold under ‘American Airlines’, a valid carrier, but the first part of the itinerary is operated by ‘Latam’, whose VWP has expired. 

Can I get one of those flights regardless of them being operated by ‘Latam’? Or will I be refused entry in the US because it wasn’t operated by American Airlines?

Bit of a dilemma regarding my itinerary and would love some advice.

Sept 9 - Sept 12 (Nice)

Shouldn't travelling be about connecting with people rather than selfies at tourist checkpoints?,"Usually I travel with 1-2 friends and very often I find myself doing the standard tourist stuff like a selfie in front of Eiffel Tower, a meal at burger and lobster, or going up the London eye. These are all things that locals rarely do. I've always preferred to travel to cities where I have friends there, but unfortunately, I do not have friends all over the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, it's nice to have a super IG-able photo from a trip, but I also want to make a local friend also. When I travel, I can't help but to wonder what people's opinions are on their country's recent politics, economics, disruptions, etc... I want to know if the 'Top 10 must try' restaurant list I read up online are really what the local people eat. There's such a big discrepancy between how a tourist sees a city and how a local sees it. Do you feel somewhat like an outsider when traveling? Would it feel nicer to have a local friend?

Day 2- Market tour/fruit tasting/cooking class with SkyKitchen. Explore Lima- Kennedy Park (cats!), Costa Verde, historic buildings, have a nice dinner and a few drinks out.

Day 3- PeruHop bus to Paracas (Ballestas Island boat tour) and Huacachina (dune buggy and sand boarding).

Day 4- Morning flight to Cusco. Check into Hotel Rumi Punku. Wander around Cusco- Plaza de Armas, Sacsayhuaman. Mostly take it easy to adjust to altitude...maybe get a massage at our hotel.

Day 5- Morning train to Aguas Calientes. Butterfly park? Check into Airbnb. Afternoon ticket into Machu Picchu.

Day 6- Morning ticket into Machu Picchu + Huayna Picchu hike. Afternoon train back to Cusco. Check into Airbnb in San Blas.

Day 7- This day is up in the air depending on how we're feeling. Would really love to see Moray and the Maras salt mines. We've seen Sacred Valley day tours that include Pisac, Maras salt mines, Moray, and Ollantaytambo...but not sure if that is too much ""on the go"". A local option in Cusco would be a chocolate workshop.

Day 8- Would really like to hike to Humantay Lake if we are up for it.

Day 9- Noon flight to Puerto Maldonado. Travel to Chuncho Lodge in Tambopata to begin 4 day, 3 night tour (Macaws Clay Lick &amp; Lake Sandoval). Canopy tower, night jungle walk.

Day 10- Macaw clay lick in Tambopata National Reserve. Jungle walk.

Day 11- Sandoval Lake.

I tend to get a little ambitious when planning because I want to experience as much as possible while there (within reason). Would love to stay in Peru longer, but due to PTO limitations, this is the best we can do.

I would also love any thoughts/perspectives on altitude sickness- I am very anxious about this. We will be getting our yellow fever vaccines soon, and consulting with the doctor about possible malaria meds as well (though I heard those can have some bad side effects). Also, is using a money belt for passports and emergency cash worth it/necessary? I have a travel backpack I usually carry my camera in, and was considering getting a backpack lock, but not sure what is smart and what is overkill- we're reasonably smart/aware travelers, but better safe than sorry? We plan to exchange some dollars to soles before we fly into Lima. All our hotels/Airbnbs offer airport pickup, so we'll mostly use that, but may need a taxi/Uber here and there. I've heard mixed information about using Uber in Peru, though. We're brushing up on some basic Spanish before traveling and have the Lonely Planet Peru book. We love photography and trying local cuisine/beverages. Any other travel/packing tips and restaurant or activity recommendations are much appreciated!",travel

1543,Traveling with a guitar Stockholm-Buenos Aires. Swiss Airlines to Zurich/ Edelweiss Air Zurich-Buenos Aires,"Hello. Has anyone travelled with a guitar with these companies I mentioned in the title?

From what I read the obvious choice is to send it in the cargo area. However this guitar belonged to my father's dad and I'm terribly afraid it will not arrive safely due to it being possibly thrown around at the BA airport. I'm Argentinian so I know how they handle items. I'm also afraid it will simply be taken as it's an expensive guitar and the hard case looks expensive as well. Two very real possibilities that would break my husband's heart. 

With a gig bag (and not the hard case) the guitar is about 106cms tall, 36cms wide at the curviest part, and 8cms deep. 

I'm not sure it will fit in the overhead compartment. I know I can ask to put it in the coat hanger. It all depends on the airline's willingness to help. So, I'm unsure about these airlines. If they have a history of cooperation or exactly the opposite.

1556,Travel Tips for Greece,"Hi team,

Heading to Greece in a few weeks and was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into the following areas:

-is it common to pay with credit or should we be using mainly cash? Research online is giving mixed opinions and much of it is quite dated.

-What is the wifi situation like? I thought I read online that wifi is accessible almost anywhere in Greece, but recent searches aren't turning up the same information.

-Can someone explain the plug adapter/voltage converter situation? Do I need a plug adapter and a step-down converter to adjust the voltage from 220 to 120, or will just a plug adapter suffice? Thinking specifically for hair straighteners, as I believe chargers for phones and laptops auto-detect and adapt to the different voltage.

-What is the ferry system like? A friend travelled to Greece 15 years ago and said it was quite unpredictable. Is that still the case or do they follow a more consistent schedule now? Which ferry company would be the most highly recommended in terms of reliability? 

-Any other bits of information you might think useful.

I'm now looking into what the area is like, where we can go eat, etc., and it looks like there are a lot of unfavorable opinions on this location! Some things I don't care about for the purpose of this trip. For example, people say there's no culture or historical attractions. We just plan to hang out on the beach, eat and drink, and maybe just get a taste of some night life (my sister will be barely 21!). That said we are not huge party animals.

I'm interested in your general opinion, but some things I'm wondering are:

Would you say the beaches are nice enough to spend most of our time there? How is the swimming? I'm guessing at the end of August itll be fairly crowded, but is it like, no-room-to-even-put-a-towel-down crowded?

Is it generally safe to stay on the main drag? I chose a less than stellar hotel a few blocks further north than the main tourist center in order to get a decent price for a place right on the beach, is that generally pretty walkable at night?

TL;DR at the top: 2 days in Santa Marta, looking for links to book day trips to Tayrona Park and Minca.

We'll be in Colombia for 1 week in total, for a wedding in Cartagena on Saturday.  We arrive Tuesday afternoon, and were planning to go straight to Santa Marta for Wednesday and Thursday.  

Ideally we'd like to do 2 day trips, potentially to Tayrona Park and Minca (but are open to suggestions) and are looking for links to day trips.  Preferrably for Tayrona Park we'd like something along the lines of jungle hike to a beach where we can relax and then return.  Not interested in snorkeling/scuba diving/etc, but want to take in the scenery. Is this something we need to purchase a tour for? 

For Minca I've seen a couple tours online that include a stop at La Victoria coffee farm which seemed cool, but am curious if anyone has any experience with this, or could suggest another tour/or way to visit Minca.  We definitely want to see the big hammocks.  

Also, for either of these, is it recommended to book lodging in Santa Marta and use that as a base?  Any advice is welcome!",travel

In August this year I am going to Switzerland/Germany with my family and have that nailed down however this coming February trip has me lost.

Another part of me wants to stay in Spain and see something unique there. I love the outdoors adventures and atypical experiences but I don't know which way to turn. I love history but know so little about Spain it is embarrassing. My wife thinks that I only go to places that I have a historical knowledge of but that I could learn about Spain in the leadup to it...and she has a point.

We want to camp everyday and are looking for some really intense hikes (like ones that have up to 5,000-6,000ft of elevation gain). We do not want to go backpacking

We are also looking for places in B.C that offer a little more than just hiking/camping. For example, maybe a lake to go swimming in or activities such as whitewater rafting (the only problem is that it has to be relatively cheap, a few of us are on a budget).

1) Mt Robson. **Pros**: Epic views, **Cons**: There doesn't seem much to do here other than hiking

2) Check out the Bridal Veils Provincial Park, Othello tunnels, Kawkawa Lake, Ladner Creek trestle. **Pros**: Seems like a lot of do in this area, **Cons** This is very close to Seattle so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to ""waste"" a long weekend here when we could theoretically check out this place another time on any normal weekend

3) Vancouver Island. We would take a ferry from Vancouver to Nanaimo and drive about 2hr north of Nanaimo for some hiking. **Pros**: Vancouver Island has cool little towns, great hikes, and it's near water to relax at. **Cons**: It's too late to reserve a ferry and we're worried about missing a ferry to get back into Vancouver. Even if we get to the ferry on-time, our concern is that we still might not get it if the ferry fills up. We absolutely have to be back in Seattle by Sunday night

I've been researching the various options for the [Venezia unica](http://www.veneziaunica.it/en) city pass.

Some sites like [this one](https://www.turbopass.de/venedig-city-pass) explicitly advertise ""skip the line"" access (but the city passes they sell are substantially more expensive and less configurable), whereas the Venezia Unica web site doesn't mention anything like it - at least I was unable to find it.

1592,Asking for advice/help for trip to Mallorca from Barcelona,"Hi! 

We will be traveling to Barcelona during the first week of September with our almost 2 year old toddler.  For the 8-days trip we wanted to split our time between Mallorca and Barcelona. Of course, we want to make the trip as hassle free as possible with the baby. 

After brainstorming a bit, we decided to just bite the bullet and fly to Mallorca as soon as we land in BCN, spend a few days there, fly back to BCN to explore the city for a few days and fly back home to NYC.  We figured this would be the most ideal than spending some time in Barcelona, flying to Mallorca, flying back to Barcelona &amp; etc. 

Anyway, now that we have decided this was the best route, I’m wondering about what to do with our luggage.  We will be trying to pack everything as compact as possible, but will still probably have 2 checked bags, stroller, car seat, diaper bag, and 1-2 carry on bag. 

The first option we looked into is packing two checked bags for each destination (one for Mallorca, one for Barcelona) as much as possible and storing our luggage at the airport.  We would still bring one checked bag, a stroller, car seat (we are renting a car), and a diaper bag/personal item on our flight to Mallorca, but load off one checked bag and 1-2 carry ons.

The second option would be to just, again, bite the bullet and bring all our luggage with us to Mallorca since we will be renting a car, but it seems like most airlines charge fees for almost everything you bring on board.  Plus it seems like a hassle to lug everything around with us.

If there are other suggestions for our luggage situation or our itinerary in general, it would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you :)",travel

Im helping an old couple (65F and 71M) plan their first trip to Europe during October-September. During it, they want to visit Spain for a week, get in a city and visit its surroundings. 

And that brings me to my question: what city would you recommend to go? Barcelona or Madrid were my first guesses, but im open to more suggestions. (Ive heard Sevilla or Santiago De Compostela are amazing too) They prefer to take long walks, visit museums and places of interest, nothing too fancy. 

As far as I have seen, Madrid has el Prado Museum, plenty of historical architecture from different time periods and, as a capital, seems pretty well connected.

Barcelona looks more tourist-y, with beaches, the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla, Gaudi's buildings,etc

Budget shouldn't be much of an issue, but they are rather frugal by just how they've always been.

1602,Possible Mistake Fare booked - tips on getting airline to honor fare?,"Good morning, I am looking to see if any of you have tips on how to proceed in my situation.

Last Tuesday I booked 2 round trip tix via Expedia on American Airlines/Iberian to Paris for $327 a piece. Obviously a great deal. Within an hour American changed one leg of the return flight by 1 hour and raised prices back up to market rates ($1040). American has not issued tickets, nor have they or Expedia cancelled the flight.

I have been on the phone with Expedia 3 times totaling 4 hours of talk time where they have tried to get me to reconfirm the flights at the changed fare, I have not reached out to American yet. Expedia claims they can do this due to a schedule change, however a 3rd level manager confirmed to me that this was because there was a mistake by American in reporting fares to Expedia for sale and they changed the prices before issuing my tix. 

First, have any of you been in a similar situation and gotten the airline/agent to honor the fare? 

If not, do any of you more experienced travelers have any tips on getting some traction on the fare being honored?

1619,"Mardin, Sanliurfa, Midyat, Hasankeyf TURKEY - My Experiences","Hi folks, I'm a 20 years old native who lives in Adana, Turkey currently. As you know, southeast of Turkey is upper part of Mesopotamia and of course, a centre for early civilizations. Since I'm not from around here actually, that part of Turkey has always been charming for me. So I decided to take a 3-day tour -respectively- Mardin, Midyat, Hasankeyf, Sanliurfa by car.

Apart from showing a basic itinerary to foreign tourists, other reason I write this post is changing your ""impression"" about ""southeast part of Turkey"". Since my childhood, I  always had knew this area as ""troublesome place"" and -to be honest- I was afraid to go such place until my grad from high school (because there was a conflict with a political party who claims defending Kurds rights but gets involved in some terroristic activity.) But nowadays, there is not such problem. According to my impression, except for Hakkari and Şırnak, it's quite safe actually. (I even don't know if there are some kind of touristic place to see there.)

&amp;#x200B;

Before starting, I want to make clear things first.

1- If you don't rent car, I suspect you can go to some far places from city. So, be ready for renting car for 1-day. I'll state those places later.

2- I specified Mardin as main point, tried to go everywhere in Mardin. But Sanliurfa had some exception though.

3- Definitely, don't include Monday in your program since museums are closed through Turkey.

4- Google ""museum pass turkey"" if you have a big visiting. If not so and if you are a student, indicating that you're student (with student id card) will help you to get a student ticket at museums.

5- Most outdoor place in Mardin and Midyat, there will be children who wants to help about simple guiding about history or location, good photo spots etc. You can ask help. They will not want money, but after you've done it is expected to give some money (2-3 TL is ok). And most likely, there will be children who sells bottled water in summer for their school expenses. Please try to get your water from them, it's cheaper than any other place and even you can get an icy one.

6- Learn a few Turkish sentences like ""Can I get a bottle of water- Bir şişe su alabilir miyim?"" or ""Can you take a photo of me- Fotoğrafımı çekebilir misiniz?"". Of course, you can add ""please-lütfen"" at the end of the sentence if you want to be super nice.

After a long road-trip, I eventually reached to Dara Ruins at 12pm. It's free and you'll find a board that tells the story about Dara (Turkish and English as well). There are some cool places that you may want to take a photo of.

&amp;#x200B;

And you'll see lots of skeletons inside main cave. That carved-rock thing at top of main cave indicates what this cave includes floor by floor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Except for main part, there are 3 more structure (cistern/dungeon) you need to see. One is right behind cafe/restaurant of main place, other two are 300m away. You can ask to one of the child waiting at entrance to get you there. Definitely go.

&amp;#x200B;

After those buildings, I suggest you go to top of village where has a dome-like small building and tombs around that. Here you go.

&amp;#x200B;

[You can see this spot from pipe-like cistern ](https://i.redd.it/nf6qqv3k6i731.jpg)

**Sakıp Sabancı Mardin City Museum - Sakıp Sabancı Mardin Kent Müzesi**

We finally got to Mardin. Actually, on our route from Dara Ruins to Mardin, there is Deyrulzafaran Monastery. I'd say stop by, I had a time problem so I went later there.

I parked the car and climbed stairs from downtown, that was awesome. Don't hesitate wondering and being lost in Mardin streets :) We are at east part of Old Mardin now.

It's not a big museum relatively, you can spend 45 min at max I guess. Entrance fee is 2 TL. It's good for you to know about Mardin. Read all boards. Try taking photos from windows looking Mesopotamia.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mesopotamia through museum's window](https://i.redd.it/kvzbysq79i731.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Zinciriye Madrasah - Zinciriye Medresesi**

For those don't know what medrese, it is Muslim thelogical school like monastery. There is no longer medrese education since Atatürk's Education Reform so it's not active.

You'll climb a bunch of great stairs, absolutely take some photo. While climbing, there is another building on your left, you can take a look. When you finally reached up there, you'll see a closed door which is the old door of medrese, get there and take a few photo.

After that, there is entrance forward ahead. Entrance is free. I don't know how, but in some way, definitely learn the meaning of the fountain and why its name is Zinciriye. And of course, doing some photography at fountain is vital :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you've finished your visiting, get out of medrese and down there you'll see a park spot. Take some photos there, too!

Then, go back to stairs and make your way to **ULU CAMİ - ULU MOSQUE**

&amp;#x200B;

**MARDİN MUSEUM - MARDİN MÜZESİ**

After leaving Ulu Cami - Ulu Mosque, this is your next stop. Try to go there by using streets, not main road, it'll be wonderful.

Entrance is 5 or 6 TL. It's built in an old Mardin house. Upper floors are full of interesting stuff, lower floor is some kind of craftshop/atelier.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**DEYRULZAFARAN MONASTERY - DEYRULZAFARAN MANASTIRI  (5 km away from Mardin)**

Next day, here is first stop. If you're staying in Old Mardin, you can postpone this a little bit.

It's still an active monastery that has living people in it with some students. Entrance fee is 10 TL. Entrances are group by group, every 30 mins. While waiting for that, try Deyrulzafaran Tea at cafe.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll climb a lot again, and up there a guide will be waiting for you, but I don't know whether they tell in English. Ask while buying ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

And bunch of good photos, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**MOR BEHNAM CHURCH - MOR BEHNAM KİLİSESİ**

This church was built for whom killed by their father for choosing Christianity. Entrance is free.

**SAHTANA FAMILY HOUSE / OLD PTT BUILDING - ŞAHTANA AİLESİ EVİ / ESKİ PTT BİNASI**

This place is just right in the middle of Old Mardin. Now, It's been using as a practice hotel (130TL per one), but you can visit. Entrance is free.

**MIDYAT- MİDYAT**

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say I'm a little disappointed about Midyat. It felt kind of not worthy to go until Midyat Guest House - Midyat Konuk Evi.

&amp;#x200B;

First stop was Midyat Caves - Midyat Mağaraları, not much to see. Entrance fee was 2 TL. Next one is the place on Google Maps called Midyat Eski Tarihi Evleri - Midyat Old Historical Houses. Along that way, you'll experience streets' and houses' soul. Don't be afraid of being lost because that won't make you help to not get lost :) Thanks to Google Maps, right ?

After following that way, go to Midyat Guest House and enjoy being in Midyat there. That house has been using for filming stuff, too. When you take a look at windows, you easily can observe stages.

[MIDYAT GUEST HOUSE'S TERRACE](https://i.redd.it/ehf7lmqz0j731.jpg)

Thereby, we just have finished our Midyat experience. Without any doubt, you can say now Mardin is more preserved in terms of culture and touristic attractions :) Time to meet with Hasankeyf.

&amp;#x200B;

**HASANKEYF**

You may not have heard Hasankeyf yet. Let me tell its story.

Hasankeyf is one of victims of Southeastern Anatolia Project. Since this project is a sustainable development, it has been a key for region and people. Agricultural and employment matters are taking a big role as well. In cause of this, Ilısu Dam will take its place in other 21 dams. And this dam's reservoir includes Hasankeyf too, unfortunately.

It's been known one of the big settlements for old civilizations and in its very own lands, it has so many different buildings such as **Zeynel Bey Türbesi - Zeynel Bey Mausoleum , Castle, Old Bridge, Artuklu Hamamı- Artuquid Bathhouse, El-Rızk Cami-Mosque,** or **caves**

Sadly, you will not be seeing most of this when you arrive there. As far as I noticed, only mausoleum has been relocated at new settlement area. A few more will be relocated that I've heard so far. Old Bridge is still there. Not only I couldn't see Castle's bottom that I like as a whole, but also I've seen a fracking dam structure that destroyed whole castle stuff and its natural caves!

Here is punchline. HASANKEYF IS EXPECTED TO BE SUNK TILL THIS WINTER. Last chance to get on train...

1621,Is it worth it to visit Hawaii for our honeymoon?,"My fiancée and I are getting married next year, and we are already starting to gather ideas of where we would like to go for our honeymoon. We have always been really interested in visiting Hawaii, but I  wanted to know if it's really worth it or if it's not as great as it seems.

We are from Spain so our idea of Hawaii is based on what we have seen of it in movies, tv shows, etc. Mainly we fell in love with Hawaii after watching things like the TV show Lost, Jurassic Park, and pretty much every movie that features the islands, forests, mountains, beaches... But I am aware that it is a very specific side of Hawaii that we have been exposed to and that you can never fully trust what a movie shows about a specific place, so wanted to know if anyone here lives there or has travelled to Hawaii that could give us a more realistic feeling of what to expect.

Really what draws us in is the great presence of nature, the overwhelming size of those green and peaceful islands and friendly, laid-back people... I guess you can get an idea of what we have been sold if you have ever watched Lost, Jurassic Park, 50 First Dates or even Lilo&amp;Stitch... you know what kind of image of Hawaii these movies normally sell.

Now, I am not naive, I am aware that we would not be staying in a private cabin surrounded by the astonishing nature landscapes I have in my mind, or bathing in deserted, cristal clear beaches (and, if that's an option, it would probably be prohibitively expensive).  Most likely we would have to stay in a massive hotel or resort in the city full of tourists and a bit far from the ""real"" Hawaii.

But I want to have a bit more information about what can be done or seen there, if it's really worth it or not... we don't want to go there expecting to be in this otherworldly place on earth just to end up disappointed if in reality it's much more mundane or doesn't have much to offer apart from relaxing beach holidays.",travel

I booked a non refundable room through hotels.com. I’ve been planning this trip for months and was positive that this resort is where I wanted to stay. I’ve been there in person before and loved it so when it was time to book the room we booked non refundable because we were so sure of how great the place was. My in-laws were looking at the website for the hotel today and noticed the the entire pool is closed during our stay. The pool was literally the whole reason we were going to this place. It’s practically a water park. This wasn’t mentioned anywhere on hotels.com and I really feel like this should’ve been very important front and center information given that the pool is why people go to this resort. Do you think I could get out of my reservation based on this? And does anyone have tips/experience with this?

1624,Type of Bag/Luggage needed for 2-weeks in Spain,"Hello community! I am going to Spain in May for 2-weeks, which will be my first time overseas (I have been to Costa Rica). I plan on doing Barcelona, Madrid, and several other cities while I am there. The flight does allow a checked bag for free if I want it. I always use a carry-on bag, but could get a bigger size luggage if needed. I will be using AirBnb so my bag/luggage will always have a good place to hang out, and I can do laundry. However, I don't know what it will be like going through the streets/sidewalks to get to these places etc. I have heard you don't want a rolling back for a longer trip as they can be a pain in the butt. I used my rolling bag in Costa Rica and it was fine (carry-on size), and that along with a hefty Swiss Gear bag carried way more than I really needed for 9-days. I rented a car in CR which made carrying it around very easy also. I have been looking at the Kelty 44, Osprey Farpoint 40, and Tortuga Setout 45 as possible bags to use, but they just seem like they don't have a ton of room. It does kind of suck that my shoe is a size 13 which takes up a lot of space. The advantage of the Swiss Army bag/luggage combo is the SA bag would hold a pair of shoes and the bag was great for a day pack (I hear some places don't allow bags like this inside though).

&amp;#x200B;

Something to think about with a bag like mentioned above is future trips. I won't always have a flight with a bag included and will be at the mercy of a carry on. With that in mind, all options need to be geared toward carry-on and personal item.

&amp;#x200B;

That was a mouthful and hopefully it made sense. Long story short: Spain, 2-weeks, multiple cities, AirBnb, I can do laundry. The main debate is does a rolling back suck for a trip like this or is it really not a big deal? Thanks!",travel

July 6-8: Zurich, Lucerne, Grindelwald

July 9-12: Venice, Florence, Rome

July 13-14: Barcelona

**In the past I've been to**: London &amp; most of Ireland.

I recently took a trip to Mongolia, and getting there included transit through China: LAX - Changsha (CSX) - Beijing (PEK) - Ulaanbaatar (ULN). I read online that the free transit visa for China only applies for those arriving/departing China from the same airport, e.g. if I had done LAX-PEK-ULN, so I thought, whatever I just won't leave the airport either time, my layovers weren't too long anyway.

What I hadn't considered was the CSX-PEK flight would be domestic, to/from domestic terminals, meaning I had to go through customs, change terminals, and go through security again. Oversight on my part, but at CSX, they didn't seem to have a problem with giving me a free transit visa, even though I was against what I thought were the rules, and going through two Chinese airports. A couple of the customs agents talked about it, but in the end I had no trouble going through customs and security (twice). 

On the way back, I had a similar experience; ULN - PEK - Chengdu (CTU) - LAX. Again, no real issues even though I thought the policy was different.

1651,Mexico travel itineraries,"I’m planning my first travel to Mexico for three weeks starting mid December this year. My initial thoughts is to travel and see major cities starting in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterey and Merida including Yucatán peninsula and returning to Mexico City. 

I’m arriving in Mexico City at 12 of December at 0400 and leaving 1 of January at 0600. 

• Week 1: Mexico City and Puebla 

• Week 2: Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido

• Week 3: Yucatán (Mérida,Cancun and Tulum)  

Mexico City on 31 and boom 💥 new year and adios. 

It’s long way till the trip begins so I’m still researching. I’m keenly interested in architectural designs and cultural heritages as an Civil Engineering major as well to expriences overall culture and food.

I do not speak a word of Spanish, however I’m assuming it shouldn’t be a big of problem conversing in English. 

I’m travel from Europe and this will be my longest flight beginning with a connecting flight of 3:15 hours flowed by 5 hours of transit and finally 15:15 hours. Pretty exciting. 

I midst of traveling around, I’ll want to spend 2-3 days around coastal areas just to hangout and chill, preferably in and around Yucatán peninsula.

I recently traveled to Croatia (Split, Dubrovnik, Korčula, Hvar) and really enjoyed myself but unpacking and repacking every four days was kind of annoying, so I think this trip I want no more than 3 destinations. 

Things that are on my “I think I would like to check this out” list:

Tegallalang Rice terraces, 
Mount batur,

Tukad cepung waterfall,

I also want to plan to stay at one of the Gili islands for part of my trip. I’m thinking Gili Air but am open to suggestions. 

I’ve heard the south part of Bali is quite dirty and poor and densely inhabited with shanty type towns. Ubud was highly recommended but I have also heard it’s a tourist trap. A friend told me the far northern portion of Bali is the most “true” to Bali and not as impacted with tourism. 

Are there any off the beaten road suggestions? Places to stay or must-do experiences? I’m going with a friend, and we are planning on booking mostly Airbnb but are also considering making one of our stays at a resort (not sure which, though - suggestions welcome). 

We are not looking for night club party type environments. We are seeking adventure and want to experience as much as we can in the short time we will be there. 

Any tips in regards to etiquette or safety precautions in Bali would be much appreciated as well. 

Also, I have a 24 hour layover in Hong Kong on the way over there. I was thinking of going to Disneyland. Looking for recommendations of things to see/do in 24 hours.

The initial plan was to travel with a kyrgyz friend of mine but due to some personal issues he won't be able to make it so now we're basically without a ""guide"".

The original idea was to go to Bishkek for two nights and then Ala Archa (day trip), and from there to Osh, then through the Fergana Valley to Andijan, from there to Tashkent and then the rest of Uzbekistan (cities I'm interested in are Samarkand, Bukhara &amp; Khiva) but now plans have changed and I believe (not confirmed yet) we may be going from Bishkek to Almaty and then from there to Tashkent. I believe the fastest way from Almaty to Tashkent is by plane so we might do that. We would be staying in Kyrgyzstan from the 17th to the 20th and in Almaty from the 20th to the 21st and then from the 21st to the 29th in Uzbekistan (not yet sure of how many days in each city).

Day 2 - Half day tour to Blue Lagoon

Day 3 - Ferry to Hvar, stay the night (night out drinking)

Day 4 (Sunday) - Blue Cave then onto Brac (Bol Beach) before returning to Split

Day 7 -  Bus/Ferry to Dubrovnik, explore the city in the evening

Day 8 - Day trip by Ferry to Mljet National Park

Day 9 - Explore, Wall Tour &amp; Night out in Dubrovnik

Day 10 - Morning explore/chill in Dubrovnik before flying home

I have planned a 16 Night trip to Switzerland this year with my wife as per the below dates and did some research to come up with a sample itinerary below.

Date of Entry to Switzerland - 27th Sep'19 (Around early morning)

Date of Exit from Switzerland - 13th Oct'19 (Around late afternoon)

Itinerary: Zurich-Bern(3N Stay)-Zermatt(4N Stay)-Wengen(6N Stay)-Lucerne(3N Stay)-Zurich

This means after arriving in Zurich Airport, wife and I will be straight away heading to Bern, similarly while coming back we will be heading to Zurich airport from Lucerne.

I know it might sound foolish to not stay in Zurich, however, we are not interested in Museums much and I am particularly interested in photographing the alpine landscapes and hiking hence the unusual long stays in both Zermatt and Wengen. We both are more or less fit for beginner to moderate hiking and would love to explore some areas on foot.

Appreciate if anyone could help with few of my concerns below:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this **itinerary crazy** by any standards?

\- I have looked at historic weather data and found the visit duration quite tourist friendly along those regions, since weather is ever changing, **anybody has any tips or insights** which we should be mindful?

\- We will be heavily relying on the public transport, and aware of the fact that Switzerland has unmatched train service, however I am little confused when it comes to travel pass/discount cards. So there are Half fare card, Swiss Travel pass, Jungfrau region travel pass, **any idea which could be the best suited in your opinion** seeing the fact that we will be extensively travelling using cable cars/trains/Funiculars in and around multiple villages and top of mountains/glaciers.

\- In my research I have found few hiking trails specially the 5 Lake trail from Zermatt. **Any beginner to moderate level Hiking in your opinion that is a must around Zermatt and Jungfrau region**? Kindly suggest please.

On the 27th June we we're riding with them from Amsterdam to Copenhagen.
Let's firstly discuss the preventables.
The bus was over an hour late, customer service said they had no intention of apologising for this as ""delays happen all the time"".
Fair enough.
Once the bus finally gets here the bus driver is among the most rude people I'd ever encountered, opens up the luggage on the side that cars drive on while being preoccupied with her cigarette instead of the safety of her passengers.

At this point you think that its stuck an all time low and that it most likely couldn't have been a worse time with this company.

Well when we crash in Germany due to the driver falling asleep it gets worse, which still somehow manages to not be the worst thing about it all but that the drivers decide to call up flixbus head office instead of calling the emergency services so we end up having to call them ourselves.

All while the drivers are too preoccupied with cooking up some story to head office we're busy dealing with the outcome.

1694,Two weeks in Spain itinerary; staying overnight in Toledo or Segovia?,"Early 30s married couple, love eating, doing some touristy stuff and getting outdoors. This will be our second trip to Spain, first time spent 4 nights in Madrid, day stop in Cordoba, 2 nights Seville, 1 Ronda, 2 Granada, 2 Valencia, 4 Barcelona. This time we will have 13 nights in August, flying in/out of Madrid, tentatively thinking 1 night Madrid area, 3 Granada, 3 Seville, 3 Cadiz, 3 Madrid. Also interested in Jerez de la Frontera, Toledo, and Segovia.

I am considering the 1 night in the beginning due to awkward arrival time and trains to Granada, and I do not want to drive. Should we stay overnight in Toledo or Segovia that night, if so which one, or is it better to just go as day trips from Madrid later on? I'd like to see both either way, but not sure if it's worth staying overnight.

Any recommendations about the order of cities, or for things to do, places to visit would be greatly appreciated! We plan on repeating only some of the touristic highlights from our first trip, such as the Alhambra, so hopefully we will have plenty of time to lounge and avoid the hottest parts of the day.",travel

Having said that, we are def looking to do at least 2 beach days. The problem is, I don’t know what would be my best choice with travel and logistics. I would like to have a morning of beginner surfing, but if it makes sense, then I’d cut that out as well.

* New Orleans (4 nights)
* Memphis (3 nights)
* Nashville (3 nights)
* Chattanooga (day trip)
* Smoky Mountains National Park (2 nights)
* Asheville (1 night)
* Savannah (2 nights)
* Charleston (3 nights)

1715,Unemployed student - tips for getting US tourist visa?,"Hello!

I want to plan a one week trip with my girlfriend to the US. I already have a date in mind that would work perfectly for us and we found some killer deals on plane tickets and a hotel. We haven’t purchased anything yet, as we’re a bit afraid of getting our visa rejected. At the moment, we are both unemployed students and next year we will be in our final year of our Bachelor. By the time we would travel, we would actually have a job as teacher assistants at our school, which would mostly fund our trip (along with savings from what our parents send us), but getting the visa then would not be the best choice, as the plane ticket and hotel prices would skyrocket. However, we’re worried that we will get our visa rejected because we don’t have any income right now. (It may also be relevant that our country’s tourist visa rejection rate is around 10%)

Would it be enough to tell them that we’re in our final year in college, right before starting our graduation project? It would be pretty obvious to me that a couple of students would have no reason to stay illegally in the US, considering the trip would be just before their big graduation project, but I have no idea how the people at the embassy see this. Also, what would we upload to the income section in the DS-160 form, just say no income ($0) and move on?

The length of time we go for will completely depend on how much money we can save but we would like to go for around 10 weeks. The places we would like to visit are Brisbane (&amp;Noosa), Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide &amp; Perth although these aren't concrete and we will visit where ever is beautiful and within our budget and time frame. We are planning on staying in hostels 4 or 5 nights per week and then in an airbnb or hotel 2 or 3 nights per week. We basically want the best accommodation for as cheap as possible. (Isn't that what everybody wants haha!) The main thing we need advice on is budgeting and what the cheapest routes to and around Australia are as well as cost saving whilst we are there. I'll leave a few questions below but any advice you have at all for a couple travelling around Australia at this time of year is very much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the cheapest route to and from Australia from the UK in January?
2. What route would you recommend as the cheapest around Australia and via what forms of transport? - We would like to drive from Brisbane to Sydney.
3. What are some good ways to pack everything you need for 10 weeks in a 65L backpack? -What do you deem a necessity and what can be left behind?
4. I have eczema - Does anyone have experience treating eczema on long trips abroad in completely different climates. I'm worried about where I can buy creams and if they will be suitable as to take 10 weeks of cream there with me would be too heavy.
5. What is the best way to go about renting a car to drive from Brisbane to Sydney? My gf has had a full UK driving license for around 2 years and will be aged 23 at the time.
6. Are there any incredible Airbnbs or hostels that you would recommend that are cheap for what you get?
7. We are thinking of potentially stopping over in Singapore on the way there and Malaysia on the way back. Is there a cheap way to do this and is it worth it or should we spend all of our time in Australia?
8. Is it worth at any point to check out New Zealand whilst we are in that area of the globe? Is it feasible to do this on a budget?
9. Are there any large events or national holidays that aren't to be missed in January to March 2020?

I'm only probably planning on spending Saturday in Auckland and flying out early Sunday. However, I may stay till Sunday night if there's something nearby cool. Thinking some sort of hike as I'm a pretty avid hiker.

After this we'll be flying to the South Island. Thinking of doing something like flying to Queenstown and flying back out of Christchurch (or vice versa).

So I'll admit I haven't done an extensive amount of research yet cause I'm a bit overwhelmed with options.

Mountain terrain, waterfalls, and all that jazz. We can probably cover about 15-20km a day so would be looking for around a 40-60km track.

1753,Swiss and Italian alps - 10 days itinerary,"I am travelling with my girlfriend through the alpine region of Italy and Switzerland for 10 days in August. I've never been to these places and would love to hear the opinions of those that have already been!

Day 1 - Landing in Milan in the morning, renting a car and driving to Chamonix, France. I've booked a hotel stay there for the first night. During the day we're planning to visit Le Panoramique restaurant and Aiguille du Midi.

Day 2 - We have a hotel in Albinen for the second night, which we'll be driving to from Chamonix and likely checking out Verbier and/or Zermatt, maybe doing some hiking (I need to do more research on this part)

Day 3 - Wake up early, see Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, do either the First Cliff Walk in Grindelwald or Birg Thrill Walk (I'm leaning towards Birg) and then stay in the Interlaken area for the night.

Day 4 - Check out Harder Kulm and Gelmer Funicular before driving and spending the night in Liechtenstein (about 2.5-3 hr drive from Interlaken).

Day 5 &amp; 6 - Wake up early and begin 3.5 hours to Dolomites, where we will stay for 2 nights. We've yet to book a place yet, eyeing Val Gardena based on others' suggestions but we'll see. We'll likely do some hiking and rent a paddle boat in Lago Di Braies during our time there.

Day 7, 8, 9 - After finishing with Dolomites, we are planning to drive to Venice, leave the car in a garage, spend 3 nights in Venice, with 1 day seeing the fishing island of Burano.

On the final day, we drive back to Milan and conclude our trip.

I'm currently in Japan, about two weeks into our trip and two more weeks left.

Before the trip I've asked several times if he's willing to try out all kinds of different cuisines, and I got somewhat of a confirmation from him. But now he refuses to try things like sushi and okonomiyaki and sushi because he doesn't like the texture and such. This applies to attraction and visiting other places too, sometimes he just doesn't show much interest even if he agreed to go.

He is a nice friend, but not a good travel companion, and there are alot of small things that irratates me. I assume I may have things that irratates him too.

1769,"My Experience with a ""Rushed"" Trip Itinerary, the Good and the Bad","Last summer a group of friends and I—all college-age—took a 10-day trip from LA. to Europe). It was my first time on a non-family trip, as well as my first time overseas or flying alone. Our planned itinerary: 2 days each in Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Vienna, and Budapest. 5 countries in 10 days (it turned out to be 6, we ended up on a spur-of-the-moment bus to Bratislava) is exactly the sort of rushed itinerary I see newcomers post on this subreddit somewhat frequently, so as someone who had actually done it before subscribing here, I thought I'd share my experience.

Did I have fun? Yes, it was a blast! Was it perfect? No, no, nope, definitely not. Here’s a list of things I thought we did right, and also a list of many things we definitely did wrong.

Things we did right:

1. Stayed on top of flight fares and policies. We started keeping an eye on ticket prices 9 months before the trip, and were prepared to buy tickets as soon as we found fares below an agreed-upon threshold; my round trip flight to Paris ended up under $300 (on WOW, but for a student on a budget I can’t complain). We did the research on things like buying tickets on a travel card for the insurance or getting around ATM withdrawal fees (I opened a Charles Schwab account), which ended up helping a lot as well when things went wrong.

2. Kept it relaxed, and accepted before starting the trip that we’re not going to be able to see or do everything, or even close to it. There wasn’t any consternation about missing out on something or wasting time, because we didn’t have many expectations of what we’d be disappointed about missing—and the things we would be disappointed about missing, we prioritized first.

3. Stayed flexible about new or unplanned experiences. Most of our best excursions on the trip were unplanned; we ended up on a day trip to Bratislava, for instance, which was a surprise destination that I very much enjoyed. Other times we went based off the recommendations of other travelers at the bus stop or locals we met along the way, and those activities were a blast, too.

Things we did wrong:

1. Not plan in any rest time. My flight to Paris was delayed, and I ended up meeting up with the rest of my group at around 7 PM in the city. At this point I had been awake for around 30 hours between the trip to LA, the wait at the airport, and me not being able to sleep in vehicles, but I was determined to make up for lost time by compressing the Day 1 itinerary (the sightseeing parts of it) into the next 3 hours. We were staying at a friend’s place, and between jet lag and excitement I wasn’t able to sleep that night, either.  The next day, we stayed out late and didn’t get back home until 3 AM, a few hours before the flight to Amsterdam. Anyways, I managed to sleep for about an hour at the airport itself before boarding, but again couldn’t sleep on the flight. Fast forward another few hours and I unwittingly knocked out on a park bench in Vondelpark, after almost 4 days of no sleep. My friends let me nap for another hour, but I kept falling asleep that day (the highlight is probably me at the Foodhallen passing out on an empty plate turned upside-down as a “pillow”). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Exhaustion hit again in Prague; we had a two late nights out in Vienna and didn’t sleep before our train to Prague. We arrived at the AirBnB and knock out at 8 PM, and we woke up the next day at 6 PM. We more or less wasted a whole day in Prague just catching up on sleep—the rest of our time in the city was great and my friends didn’t mind at all, but I thought it was pretty bad.

2. Trying too hard to do things as a group/not sufficiently planning around individual limitations. One member of our four-person group was vehemently against spending money on tours, museum tickets, activities, etc. It wasn’t a budget restriction, he didn’t like doing those sorts of things, and got a lot of enjoyment out of finding things that were cheap or discounted. It worked out great for our flight fares, but was a hassle when we wanted to see the Anne Frank museum or the Louvre, for instance (we ended up doing neither). Another member of our group was on a budget, which was understandable. In our planned finances I said the trip might be up to $1500 including airfare per person, which I thought was reasonable for a 10 day trip in western/central Europe, especially staying in mostly hostels. He agreed and bought the tickets, but when we actually were on the trip we found out that he didn’t have that nearly that sort of money allocated for the trip, which also affected what we could and couldn’t do since for some reason we all had the notion we had to do everything together. By the time we got to Vienna, me and the other friend finally suggested splitting up if we wanted to do something the other two didn’t, and I think all of us benefited from that decision. We still did most things as a group, but everyone being able to do what they wanted to do was such a simple change that didn’t even cross our minds before this.

3. Related to the above, we kept “running out of things to do,” which sounds terrible but felt true at the time. For instance, we spent our second day in Amsterdam (probably my low point of the trip) doing next to nothing because I simply could not find anything through Google, word of mouth, or otherwise that the group wanted to do. We went to the Foodhallen a second time; I took the aforementioned extended nap; we walked around for about 6 hours without actually entering any stores or doing any activities; we ate dinner; we then walked around another few hours, again without actually stopping anywhere, before calling it a night. In total we visited just 1 place (the Foodhallen), had two meals, and otherwise just walked around the city for the other 10 hours because we had either done everything on my list or considered it unviable (anything that cost money was automatically out of the picture, and by the time we thought about leaving the city it was too late to actually do anything in our destination before having to head back to the hostel). The reasons were a combination of all of the above: poor planning, travel companion restrictions, and shortness on time.

______

So if you have some 2-days-a-country itinerary lined up, I would give the following takeaways.

1. Is it doable? Yes. Is it enjoyable? I had fun on my trip, but at the same time I essentially wasted two days of it by being exhausted. If I were to do a rapidfire trip again, I would try to spend at least 3 days in a city, just to slow down the pace and give myself time to recuperate. People here suggest sticking to one or two places for a weeklong trip for a reason, but it's understandable to want to see a lot of different places without necessarily wanting to get deep into the culture and atmosphere. Still, at least 3 days is what I'd recommend to avoid severe burnout.

2. Consider sticking to a small-ish geographic region. I can't say I particularly enjoyed waking up early after next to no sleep multiple days in the row to catch the planes to Amsterdam and Prague. On the other hand, I think part of the reason I enjoyed Bratislava so much is the lack of rush associated with it; it wasn't on the itinerary in the first place so there was nothing that needed to be done, and the train back to Vienna was short and hassle-free.

3. This one seems obvious in hindsight, but if it's your first trip it might be taken for granted. Make sure you know your travel partners and their preferences. I learned the hard way that some people have very, very different tastes when it comes to travel.

Overall, I enjoyed the trip and considered it a learning experience, and I think I'll look back on it fondly and remember the moment I arrived in Amsterdam and thought, ""yeah, I can spend a full day here even though I haven't slept since I left L.A.!"" I'm going to the UK for another 2-week trip this month and have definitely learned from it myself. Best of luck to anyone else planning their first multi-city trip!",travel

1772,Traveling Europe in January and need some suggestions/tips,"So this January, my brother and I plan to travel to Europe the day after Christmas and stay for about 2-3 weeks.

It might be too many with regards to only having 2-3 weeks to spend there so if we should cut out any countries due to time, feel free to let me know. The countries we want to visit are **Italy (Venice and Rome?), Switzerland (Ski the alps for a day?), Germany (Munich &amp; Berlin), Poland (Auschwitz if we have the time and it's not too expensive to get there), Netherlands (Amsterdam), Belgium (only because we are passing through it but don't know where), and France (Paris)**.

My first set of question for all of you travelers is about places to visit. Do you think that we have enough time to hit all of these countries? If not, what should we cut out? What place is the best to celebrate New Years? What places do you suggest seeing while at said cities (Good restaurants, must see monuments, etc.)?

My next set of questions goes for getting to different countries. What mode of transportation do you think would be best going between cities? What are some good websites or transportation companies that offer pretty cheap flights/train tickets?

I'm traveling to Switzerland with my boyfriend (Geneva) in July, and we're going to stay in the country for six days. I am hoping you can share your experiences if you've been there and hopefully some tips on what to see and do.

We're arriving in Geneva early in the morning, we've never been there before so we're very very excited!- what are your favorite spots there? any must-see places? we LOVE food, so you have a favorite restaurant or bar there please also let us know! Also, do most shops and restaurants take cards or we should take some cash with us?

Although we do want to spend some time (a few hours) in beautiful Geneva, since we're both really into cycling we'd like to rent some bikes and go out of town to explore the countryside. Are there any bike rental shops you'd recommend? The main reason why we've chosen to go to Switzerland is that we love spending time out in the nature so we're mostly interested in mountains, natural parks, lakes and so on. We really like camping, so we're actually taking all our equipment with us and we hope we can just camp instead of having to spend money on accommodation (our budget is quite tight and prices are rather high). Any tips on camping in Switzerland? 

My next question is about the itinerary we should follow. Since we're arriving in and departing from Geneva, it is a must that our itinerary starts and ends in the city. I did find some national cycling routes online, but it is quite difficult to pick one... If any of you has cycled around the country, which route did you follow? which towns, parks or lakes would you recommend visiting? We're both in good physical condition and cycle regularly during spring and summer, so an intermediate level route would be ideal for us.

My last question is about public transportation - We'd like to cycle as much as possible, but we were wondering if there is any public transport that allows you to take your bike with you.

It’s going to be a long flight but at a pretty convenient time as it’s around dinner and I should be able to eat before then. However when I wake 7+ hours into the flight, I will probably be ravenous.

I would like to know before I get to the airport, from anyone who has travelled with this airline before- how does food work? I saw an option to add this “feature” for extra $ when I was booking it but chose not to at the time.

If you don’t book for food, will they still feed you? Can you still order from the menu and pay for food/drink? 

Additionally, I’m flying on an A330-200. Do they come with built in TVs or offer ipads? Does it cost money to watch movies with them?

I did try looking this up but not everything is clear on whether or not these features may be “optional” or come with the flight. I would love to just be certain on this before getting on the plane.


Last of all, if you have a carry on bag, do they check/measure the size? It just has to fit in the overhead cabin or underneath your seat right? What if it’s too fat to fit in the overhead cabin? Can you take some stuff out and shove it in the seat pocket to make it fit?",travel

The backpack was really uncomfortable to wear so I decided that I should buy a hiking or a travel bag, maybe I was wrong between them because now my mother is insulting how it looks on me, it can’t fit anything (even tho I bought it a normal sizes not so big so I don’t look funny when I go out for casual stuff + we had to fit in her bag which was big and still she says the shop which I bought from ripped me off. The backpack is called Osprey Stratos 34. Currently I am doing fine and have another trip to only thing is that behind my shoulders are hurting maybe because I am standing upwards a lot which is a good thing ?

1782,Travel Video Equipment,"Hello all, just trying to get a check on what people use for video equipment when they travel. I have a bit of a dilemma in which I am conflicted about. Basically I am looking to do some travel vlogging via my smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) or my GoPro. While the GoPro shoots much higher quality video and is much more robust, it is an additional piece of equipment that takes up valuable space in my day pack and I find myself juggling multiple devices at times just to “capture a moment”. While both are excellent tools, I find myself having too much photography equipment to carry around when I factor in my drone as well as my pocket 360 camera.

Looking to see how others (particularly travel vloggers) deal with this issue.

I am going to Tanzania in about a month. I will be in Tanzania for 2 weeks Arriving at Dar Es Salaam, Arusha (with 2 days safari to  Ngorongoro Crater  and Lake Manyara), Moshi (5 day Kili climb) and Zanzibar for a few days.

I live in Japan and travel vaccinations are not included on the health insurance here so they are pretty expensive. I had most my vaccinations many years ago in the UK. In Japan I managed to get the Yellow Fever Vaccine a few months ago in Japan (was an absolute mission but technically got it free as it's in a trial stage here) and I just paid out approx $300 for Hep A booster, Typhoid and 50 Doxcy tablets. This at least pretty much clears me for the main required vaccinations.

However, the vaccination for Cholera (is somewhat recommend but optional from my research) will cost me approx $170 here in Japan.

My question is, has anyone ever gone to Tanzania (and the places I am going to) without this vaccination? Is it required? Would safe precautions with food/drink + water purification tablets help? 

I don't really want to pay out that much for it as this trip is already quite a lot.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1805,Saving Jars of Dirt,"I saw Saving Private Ryan on opening weekend in July of ’98.  The epic war drama is, almost twenty-one years later, still one of my favorite films... though I’ve only seen it a couple of times.  If you’ve seen it, you know it can be hard to watch.  I clearly remember the entire audience openly sobbing after the beach scene.  The film’s realism can be almost unbearable at times, and its expert character development really makes you feel for the soldiers... to understand them as if they were real people that you know... to hurt when they hurt, laugh when they laugh, and to weep for their families when they’re gone.  Of course, I’d expect nothing less from Spielberg.

&amp;#x200B;

When I watch a movie like that, or read a really engrossing book, I imagine which character I most identify with... or which is most like myself.  In Saving Private Ryan, Tech Sergeant Mike Horvath is me.  He’s not the hero, he’s not the sexy one, and he’s not the cool one.  Sergeant Horvath is the guy who says what he thinks, and stands up for what he believes is right... no matter what.  He’s Captain Miller’s only real friend, and Captain Miller is his.

&amp;#x200B;

Without just coming right out and saying, “Hi, I’m so-and-so from wherever”, Spielberg carefully peppers Saving Private Ryan‘s characters with little back stories in the form of conversations and poignant visuals.  In particular, one of these very brief shots has stayed with me all these years.  Upon securing the beach at Normandy, Sergeant Horvath is seen filling a small can with dirt.  Putting the lid on the can, we see it’s labelled “France”.  He then places the can into his backpack with other cans labelled “Africa” and “Italy”.

&amp;#x200B;

Much like travelers of bygone years would affix stickers to their steamer trunks, these were Sergeant Horvath’s souvenirs.

&amp;#x200B;

In the midst of war, he couldn’t very well stroll through the giftshops of Paris or the markets of Tunisia for souvenirs to take home to his family.  What he did instead was collect a little bit of the place, itself.  The dirt in those cans were a tangible part of where he’d been... mementos of places and experiences more meaningful than any t-shirt or snow-globe could ever be.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know why, but that really stuck with me.  I love the thought of it... of bringing home a piece of the place, and not just some kitsch trinket that probably wasn’t even made there.  This isn’t a reminder that I once visited France.  This is France.  And so, I started doing it, myself.  Whenever I travel to a new place, I try to collect a little piece of it.  I’ve got sand from various beaches and dirt from various cities and parks and water from rivers and lakes.  I haven’t been successful in getting these little “samples” from every place I’ve been, but definitely a lot of them.  And I haven’t been even remotely successful in collecting them all in the same kind of container, either... they’re a bit of a mish-mash of what I had available at the time, but I love them.  They’re a unique sort of souvenir, and it’s fascinating to see the differences in the colors and textures.  Right now, all my little jars are piled up on the fireplace mantle, but I hope to someday build a proper display for them.

1806,[Discussion] Your Airport Habits,"I have nothing going on this Thursday afternoon so I just wanted to spark some discussion with anybody who is willing to engage!

- What are your airport habits when travelling

- How early do you arrive for check in? 

- Have you ever cut your check-in a little *too* close?

- Do you have routines before/after going through security? 

- Do you prefer direct flights or layovers?

- If you have a layover, do you like a short or long layover?

- What types of things do you do to pass the time during a layover?

- Other airport habits or routines?

Sometimes I'm a pretty rushed person, but for travelling I usually take a sort of ""hurry up and wait"" approach. The main airport I fly out of is about a three hour drive from where I live, so if I'm driving there the same day I like to leave about six hours before my flight and am not opposed to leaving even earlier if theres a chance of running into traffic during rush hour or the possibility of inclement weather.

My airport is pretty easy to check into, but I always check in at least 2 hours prior to my flight. I even do this at super small airports where most people say you can check in 30 mins to an hour before your flight time. 

After I check in I like to find a place to sit outside of security where I do quick self bag check to make sure I didnt absent mindedly pack prohibited carry on items, stow my keys, remove my belt if wearing one, and ready my boarding pass(es) and ID so I can move through security as quickly as possible. First thing I do after going through is to find a water fountain to fill my bottle at, locate my gate, give my phone a final charge and just enjoy the airport atmosphere somewhere nearby my gate. 

I actually want and hope for a layover. The longer the better. Up until about... 10 or 12 hours. An 8 hour layover is great! The same intial routine goes on after I enter the new airport: fill water, locate gate. Once I've found my gate and confirm that it still has the correct destination listed, I go on an airport exploration. Airports are the very best for people watching so I'll do plenty of that, I'll walk around and look at the different displays of art or signs which that city's airport likes to display, scout which airport food I want to eat, and maybe grab a drink. For whatever reason I love to just waste a day in the airport and long layovers ensure I dont have to ever feel rushed.

Anyway, that was probably all way more information than anybody cares about, but feel free to describe your traveling habits and thoughts!",travel

1815,Revised Europe Itinerary,"I'm back with a *little* bit of a better idea of what is going on. My plan in my previous plan was too ambitious, so I cut Croatia and the French Riviera. Please take a look at my revised itinerary and offer any suggestions (if you feel like it).

The only things that are set in stone are the following:

I get into London on July 6th then fly to Paris (was cheaper than Eurostar) on July 10th. From Paris, I fly to Milan on July 16th. I am in Italy from July 16th- August 9th. On August 9th, I fly from Naples to London and only have one day there before its back to the US.

I am planning on getting around Italy primarily via train. Here's a rough sketch of what I would like to do:

* Milan (16-17)
* Lake Garda (17-18): Sirmione or Malcesine ??
* Verona (18-19)
* **Venice** (19-22)
* **Florence** (22-25)
* Lucca (25-27): Day trip Pisa
* **Rome** (27-3)
* **Amalfi Coast (3-8**): Sorrento, Capri, Positano, Salerno??
* Naples (8-9)

1835,London/Amsterdam/Paris itinerary,"My wife and I will be spending 12 days in Europe in September. Below is how we are planning to split the days so far: 

Day 1: Arrive early morning in London

Day 2: London

Day 3: London 

Day 4: London 

Day 5: London 

Day 6: Early train to Amsterdam

Day 7: Amsterdam

Day 8: Amsterdam, late train to Paris?

Day 10: Paris

Day 11: Paris

Day 12: Paris

The London part of the trip we're pretty set on, we're kind of torn on the Amsterdam/Paris part, specifically Day 8 and Day 9. Would it be better to spend the night on Day 8 in Amsterdam and head to Paris early morning Day 9? Or head to Paris late Day 8 so we have 4 full days in Paris? 

Things we want to see in Amsterdam: Anne Frank house, Vondelpark, Jordaan, Red Light District, canal tour, A'DAM Lookout, Van Gogh museum, Zaanse Schans.

Things we want to see in Paris: Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Champs-Elysees, Pont Neuf, Versailles, Dôme des Invalides, Sainte-Chapelle, Montmartre, Paris Catacombs.

Any advice? Based on our plans so far, I'm kind of leaning towards heading to Paris early morning on Day 9.

If for some miracle it does get here on the 2nd my daughter and I can go to the post office (after making an appointment for passport service) on the 3rd. If I pay for the expedited service it “should” take 2-3 weeks for us to receive it.  Our trip is on the 2nd of August so basically 4 weeks from when we renew and our trip.

1859,Spanish Honeymoon Itinerary Ideas,"I'm getting married in January of next year and one of the places my future wife has always wanted to see for the majority of her life is Spain.  I've never been either so I figured it would make for a great honeymoon destination.

I've gone ahead and booked our plane tickets so that we will arrive on February 6 in Barcelona and we will be departing Barcelona on February 15 (8 full days).  Early brainstorming ideas led to us thinking that we would like to have the trip structured around Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville.  (But we're both open to seeing whatever since we haven't made any accommodations yet)

Our basic idea was to arrive in Barcelona mid-day at the beginning of the trip and stay one night to recover from jet lag since we'll be flying from Houston, Texas.  The morning after we arrive we'd take a train to Seville and work our way back to the northeast to Barcelona.  We had intended on leaving the last couple days for Barcelona so that we can relax prior to flying back home.

Other cities which I've heard are nice to visit are Toledo, Cordoba, Grenada.  We're not looking to be constantly hotfooting around since this will be a honeymoon so we're looking for a leisurely and fluid itinerary.

Both of us love architecture and food and drink.  My future wife loves the coast and culture, I love history and rugged mountains.  We'll have a budget of around 5k so we have flexibility but can't really go overboard.

Day 2: Head to Positano in the morning (is the best way to do this just pay for a private car? We are both pretty susceptible to motion sickness and have heard the bus can be a nightmare. Any recommendations for safe and affordable options?)

Day 3-7: We have a spot in Positano for 6 nights (I know this is a lot, but we had an amazing deal at a place and needed to stay for the extended period).

Day 8: Head to Capri early morning on ferry and spend the night (any need to pre book or get there early for ferry from Positano?)

Day 9: Spend the morning / early afternoon on Capri and catch a later ferry to Naples (is there a risk of this being full in early September / is there a way to prebook). Spending night in Naples at a hotel near airport.

We want to celebrate our time together so we figured we should go for a magical trip! We are from Norway and we will be travelling from Oslo. We have thought mainly about Asia/Africa. As we have travelled extensively through Europe. The Caribbean could also be an option. 

Length is 12 full days

Budget is Somewhere around $5000, including flights, would be good. Less than that would be better. We like nice hotels, but we would also like to have the possibility to both see things and have some days at the beach. 

From before have we travelled in the following countries in Asia that we dont want to revisit: Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Israel, vietnam.

For climate we would really like something tropical due to the vast coldness of a norwegian summer. We are travelling in september this year.

Our interests are hikes, and food. We love tasting food from all over the world and we are not picky! As I mentioned before I would like to have the possibility to see something special and have the closeness of a beach. (For my fiance). When it comes to music we really like live jazz, blues and Cuban style.

We dont want to get robbed or mugged on our trip only precautions we have. We are fluent in several languages; Italian, Spanish, polish and english as well as the nordic. 
(No Finnish:( ) 

I'm a little stuck, so any help would be great.

1885,Finding good travel insurance,"After reading some old posts in this subreddit, I decided to buy travel insurance for my wife.  When I search [insuremytrip.com](https://insuremytrip.com) or other sites, I find a variety of companies with similar offerings.  When I search for those companies, I find that there are always a lot of bad reviews, with two stars or less on sites like yelp.

I realize that the people with bad experiences may be more likely to leave reviews, but how can I evaluate an insurance company without just taking a chance and hoping that I get a good one?  I want to buy travel insurance, but am really apprehensive about who to go with.

1889,Travelling to New York:,"Hello,

Me and my partner will be travelling to NY for five nights in June next year. Staying at the Grand Hyatt New York is that helps. (Booked early because I wanted something to look forward too!) 

There were a few questions I’ve struggled to get answered from google. I’ve contacted the hotel and still awaiting a response. 

I know we have to pay a $30 resort fee per night of stay at the hotel. I’ve had some conflicting information- is it best to take a spare credit card with us to use to pay this? As well as using this card for the deposit they like to take in case anything happens to the room? 
- I’ve heard it’s not good to use a debit card. 
Is there then tax added onto this $30 fee? 

Our check in is at 16:00pm and we arrive in Manhattan at around 14:00pm. They said we can head to the hotel and ask if we can check in early but it depends on room availability and how busy they are. Although they said we could leave our bags at the hotel whilst we go out and explore. Would we expect to have to pay for this privilege? I’ve researched local storage facilities for luggage and there are some cheap ones. I wouldn’t want to use the hotels and get stung with a heavy fee. 

What are some of your personal recommendations. We have a whole list of standard tourist places to visit but I love to find quirky attractions/bars/restaurants to really make a trip special.

We were planning to fly from Calgary, AB to Japan since it's the only direct flight to any of the 4 of countries from our city.

1891,Where to go on my trip to Italy in late-October,"I have a trip scheduled to Italy (flying in to FCO) October 19-28. I went last year at that time to Cinque Terre, Florence, and Rome, but was hit by a massive storm while I was there, so I’m hesitant to go somewhere beachy on this trip because of that experience.

Currently I’m deciding between visiting the Amalfi coast area (Sorrento, Capri, and Positano) or staying more central (Bologna, Pisa/Lucca, Parma). So I’m hoping this sub might be able to provide some help and insight.

About me. American, mid-20s, female solo traveler. I studied abroad in Umbria and am pretty comfortable getting around, but want to avoid renting a car. I’ve seen most of the touristy stuff in central Italy. This trip was mainly booked because I got a great deal on tickets (thanks Scott’s Cheap Flights!) and I love Italy. When I go, I’ll be about a year into a massive weight loss (probably 100+ lbs by then) and am hoping to do some shopping (but I’m not interested in going to Milan). I want to eat some good food (if I stay in central Italy, I’m planning to go to Euro Chocolate in Perugia for a day), and also enjoy the relaxing pace and beauty of Italy.

Please help! If you think I should go somewhere else entirely, let me know!",travel

1904,25F seeking advice on where to spend five days in Europe!,"Hi! I apologize for the lengthy post, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible! I need advice for where to go during one leg of my upcoming trip to Europe August 3-18! Here is my itinerary:  


August 4:  Arrive in London at 1:15PM (just staying overnight with a friend before my flight out the next morning)

August 5-8: Lisbon solo trip (roundtrip flight booked, and stay at Yes! Hostel booked)

August 8-12: Back to London, arriving at 4:25PM on the 8th. Spending the long weekend with family.

**August 12--16:** **UNDECIDED**

August 16-18: Back to London. Spending the weekend with a friend. Heading home at 8:50AM on the 18th. 

\*\*\*side note:  I know my scheduling seems a bit odd, but I have to be in London the 8-12 and then again the 16-18 for commitments I made with family and friends, but I didn't want to spend ten full days in London as I've already been twice before, so I want to take another little trip between.  


So all my travel and accomodations are taken care of except what to do August 12-16. I most likely be spending this part of the trip with a friend, but there is a chance I might be going solo, so I'm looking for a place that would be safe for a solo female traveller. 

**Budget:**   
Willing to spend around $200 round trip from London to whichever destination I choose. I plan to be staying at a hostel, hoping to stay to $50 or less per night. Not too concerned with anything else budget-wise.

**Interests:**   
\-I really like the idea of somewhere that has beautiful beaches, so on the coast or an island. I would love to do some sight-seeing, but nothing to fast paced. I want this to be a low-key, relaxing trip.  
\-Good food (duh)  
\-I love going out to bars/pubs, but NOT clubs  
\-Somewhere that is accessible via plane/train and easy to get around via public transit and/or walking and/or taxis/ubers. I will not be renting a car.   


I had some places in mind that I would love any feedback on. But I also would be open to literally ANY suggestions you might have based on my budget/interests!

**-Ibiza and/or Palma**

**-Amalfi Coast, but staying in Amalfi or Positano (I've already been to Sorrento). I think I would probably fly into Rome on the 12th, spend a night there, then leave early on the 13th to head to Amalfi or Positano.** 

**-Split, Croatia with possible trips to** **nearby islands.** 

My main questions/concerns with these locations: Are they easy to get around without renting a car? Are they good places to visit solo in case my friend isn't able to join me?   
**Also wanted to note, I have already traveled to these places and would like to avoid revisiting:**

\-Amsterdam

\-Paris

\-Florence

\-Rome (would be willing to spend a night here to get to the Amalfi Coast, but don't want to make it my primary destination)

\-Cinque Terre

\-Athens

\-Delphi

\-Frankfurt

\-Baden Baden

My girlfriend and I will be traveling for approximately two weeks (a little more would be okay as well) in August somewhere after the 4th of August.

We are looking for a place outside Europe since we have seen plenty of this continent already (despite that there is still plenty more to see). 

At the moment our preferable options would be Japan or Colombia. However, Japan will be very difficult since we have 1500€ as budget per person (excluding flight) as maximum. And unfortunately the flights from Amsterdam (where we reside) to Colombia are very expensive at the moment which will deplete much of our spending budget. Besides, many other options cannot be taken into consideration because of heat (India) and monsoon seasons like in South East Asia. 

As to what we like I would say; we are open to every option actually. But would like to exclude Indonesia since we were there last year.

It is weird and feels wrong that they put me into a wheelchair whether I say I need it or not. I really just need someone to walk with me but I guess they do not offer that.

But preboarding? I get off the plane just as fast as anyone else does and I have to sit and wait for an airport assistant to pick me up at the gate anyway. 

Sure, crowds give me a panic attack- but it is over in like 2 minutes... then I am in my seat.

1922,Question about whether BritRail pass is worth purchasing for upcoming UK trip.,"Hi all,

My wife and I will be staying around ipswich for the first 2 weeks of July and we weren't 100% sure how the BritRail pass works for foreigners. We'd love to travel the entire island, (Bath to Lancaster to Kyle of Lochalsh to Iverness to Edinburgh). I assume from my limited research that the BritRail pass would be cheaper for such an ambitious trip, but I was hoping someone with more knowledge/experience could tell me if that was correct or not.

1924,Question about Domestic to International flights.,"I am flying from LAS to IAD. Originally I had planned on going home once landing at IAD. My girlfriend wanted to go on a trip overseas and we booked it so I wouldn’t have to leave the airport. We are flying out of IAD to Iceland. These are two separate flights with two separate airlines. This is not a layover at IAD. I have no checked bags, just carry ons. Would I be required to go through security again? Or could I wait in the terminal until she gets there?

Edit: thanks everyone for the answers! If all goes well and I’m on time I should have about 3 hours to figure it out. If anything I can try to just walk to the gate. If I can get there I’ll just board as normal if I run into any issues hopefully they can deal with them at the gate.",travel
1925,Has traveling to a city you once awed just felt less special after you've been there?,"It's kind of a hard feeling to describe, it's like the Woody Allen line ""I'd never join a club that would allow a person like me to become a member"".

It seems to me that a big part of the allure of a destination is just having never been there, and seeing the pictures, videos and stories on the internet just built it up like crazy--kind of like admiring a celebrity and once you talk to them you just realize they're human.

Similarly once you travel somewhere you just realize it exists like anywhere else, and then you leave it and you realize travelling there wasn't necessarily something you earned a right to go there like it is with some other things in life--it was just the ability to pay for a plane ticket and take the time to do it.

Now don't get me wrong--I've loved every trip I've been on, always for different reasons and will continue to explore as many places as I can, while I can, but to me the concept and idea of traveling seems to always be better than the experience itself.",travel

1929,Just Came Back from Cairo...uhh whoa,"I don't think I have been anywhere as intense as Cairo. I got hassled EVERY time I was on the street, constantly without exception. It got to the point where I started living in this reality where nothing anyone said was real and everything was a complete utter lie. I was with my (white, western) girlfriend and I felt like I was her hired security detail just to get her from site to site. I am Asian and I am not sure if that is what caused more attention or not. Even when I was on the street without her, I got hassled by everyone except a select few who were wearing suits. 

I would say it was still worth it to see the pyramids, because they are just on another level of majestic greatness. But, it required A LOT of everything. A lot of patience. If they didn't have Uber (or Careem) there, I would say this place would be 100% not worth to go. I can't even imagine having to deal with scam taxi drivers on top of the scam hustlers everywhere else. Literally, every restaurant, every salesmen on the streets, every person approached me even to just go to the grocery store was out to get to my wallet. If I bought beer at Drinkies in Tahir Square, EVERYONE knew what was in the black bag and desperate to get me to buy them alcohol. (I was told that yes anyone is allowed to buy alcohol but they do not want to be seen purchasing alcohol.) I had one guy BLOCK my elevator to beg me to buy him some beer and I had to physically move him out of the way and threaten him until he backed off. That's how far they are willing to take it. I had TWO people use their bodies to block my Uber to the pyramids to claim a guide is required and that they were the guy to take. Yes, you read that right they got HIT by my Uber driver's car to force him to stop! 

&amp;#x200B;

If my girlfriend was more than a meter away from me, she got SURROUNDED by local Egyptian men. Hassled. Groped. The moment I reappeared, they scurried away like rats. It was truly insane. Morocco was Disneyland compared to this. I read that \*\*99%\*\* of Egyptian women have been sexually harassed. If I didn't have a little imposing size and a trained fighter, I am not sure how I would feel walking around Cairo with a woman. Unfortunately, no was not accepted as an answer until I forced it to be the answer - I have never in my extended experience of traveling had to resort to being physical to get hustlers to back off. Even a proper gift shop across from the Egyptian Museum tried to lie to me and give me wrong change scam! Just shameless.

&amp;#x200B;

So be warned, and nothing will truly prepare you for it. You can research it like crazy, like I did, but it barely gives you a head start of what you will experience. Over 50 countries traveled and this left me in awe of how insanely shitty a culture can be towards guests.",travel

1933,"Seeking EC 261 compensation for not being put on next available flight after ""extraordinary circumstances"" caused missed connection.","My relatives had a connecting flight from JFK via CDG on AF. Their flight from JFK to CDG landed 1.5h late due to ATC restrictions at JFK, and the original itinerary had a 1.5h layover. The next available flight was on a SkyTeam airline, leaving 2.5h after their arrival (3.5h after their originally planned arrival).

I was on (Facebook) Messenger with an AF rep while the plane was still taxiing, and they refused to move them to that flight, citing limited availability. That flight was not bookable with cash on AF's website, but it was bookable with Flying Blue miles on AF's website OR with cash on the carrier's website. They got put on a flight that departed 2.5h later still. Doing the math, that's:

I want to travel more when I'm young, and I finally have the disposable income to make that happen. SO I plan to rent my room in NYC out for that month, and now the question is where will I go and what will I do? Dates are Jan 1st or 2nd to Jan 31.

Activity Options: I would like to spend my time in January learning about food/culinary arts, hiking, surfing (I'm a beginner), teaching swimming (I'm an expert), teaching English, painting, or even bartending! Yes I have looked into WWOOFING but January isn't a very active month for agriculture.

1937,Help please!,"A very long and harrowing tale, please stick with it. 

My friend and I are travelling on the very very cheap, and had booked all of our Accomodation through Airbnb months in advance from home. For the most part we’ve done pretty well and gotten good locations, others we’ve gone a bit out of the way assuming public transport would save us. 

Our 2 month trip started yesterday, she flew in at 5:45 and I met her at the airport (having been here on a tour 2 weeks already). From the airport we got a train to Tiburtina, and then jumped onto the metro to Rebibbia where we were supposed to get the bus to Pisoniano. This is where it all fell apart. Every time we had asked for help, trying English, broken italian and using translations to show people working in information booths, we were turned away because they didn’t know. By the time we got to where we needed the bus, the direct bus had stopped running and the indirect bus was about to, we didn’t know how to use that and both of our phones were soon to die. The drive from that bus stop to our Accomodation was meant to be about 31 minutes, so we made the decision to use a taxi (fully aware it would be expensive). 

The taxi came, we got in, and the driver makes it to a toll gate before telling us it’s not actually in Rome so he’s going to need to charge double the metre for the return. By this point, it’s past 9pm and my friend and I are both exhausted so we say sure, whatever, there’s really nothing else we can do at this point. The trip takes closer to an hour, and the metre ends up at $82 - the driver charges us $145 rather than a direct double. My friends travel card which was connected to the app wouldn’t work, so we tried adding my card to pay with that - no luck. Eventually we scraped together just enough, using ALL the cash we had and finally made it out of the taxi and to the Airbnb.

 It’s an independent one, so the host isn’t here to let us in and we struggle for 10 minutes trying to open the door before finally giving up  and asking some lovely neighbours for help. Straight to sleep, plans to fix things in the morning. Morning comes, we’ve seen the request to cancel 3 nights of our reservation ant this Airbnb and have booked a hostel closer to where we need to be. We head off in search of a grocery store to buy food and bus tickets so we can leave tomorrow, find a bar and get some sandwiches, try to buy our tickets and snacks - only cash allowed, and obviously we have none. The lady very kindly gives us our sandwiches for free, but we cannot pay for anything so obviously can’t take the bus tickets with us. Can’t find an ATM or a bancomat ANYWHERE so eventually give up and come back where we need to ask help AGAIN in opening the door. 

Now, we have no idea how to buy our bus tickets to get out of here, the Airbnb host has declined our change in reservation and we still have no cash aside from a few euro in coin, (but not enough to pay for the sandwiches as well as bus tickets), only cards. What are our options?

Our nearest international airport is O'hare in Chicago, and we are in the central time zone. We are considering several countries in South America. Peru is a bucket list destination but when we go to Peru, we'd like to hike the Inca Trail and we don't think wet season is a good time to do that. I've heard wonderful things about Colombia and airfare seems reasonable right now! Even though I mentioned that we might be Europed out, I would be interested if there is somewhere that has Christmas markets and lights up that early... but best case scenario is that we can go somewhere that is similar to our time zone, and isn't too far away.

Hard currencies like CNY, USD, EUR, JPY, and CAD trade at a lower commission than less widely used currencies or more foreign currencies like NZD or MXN.

The rate they list already has commission factored into it. If they say 1 USD equals 7.4 HKD, they will slide 7.4 HKD across the counter when you hand over one dollar.

The following line is printed onto every receipt (keep the receipt!): A customer may cancel an exchange transaction within 3 days and obtain a refund if the original currency tendered in exchange for the Equivalent Amount shown above if the money changer fails to comply with the [Money Changers Ordinance \(Cap. 34\)](http://www.msoa.hk/faq_mco_en.html).

* Once you decide your route, check the [border wait time](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html) for  your chosen border crossing in advance. This may save your travel time.  Also, to save wait-time at border, avoid travelling during peak periods

1958,Argentina Trip in December/January,"Hola! My girlfriend and I are planning to travel to Argentina after our wedding in mid-December this year. We have around 22 days and intend to cover the following: 

* Buenos Aires – 4 days 
* Iguazu – 2 days 
* Mendoza – 4 days 
* El Calafate and El Chaltén (for Perito Moreno and Fitz Roy) – 5 days 
* Ushuaia (for Tierra Del Fuego) – 3 days 

That leaves us with four additional days, and we wanted some inputs on which places are recommended (we are not sure about Bariloche, Península Valdés and Torres Del Paine). We’re nature lovers and are excited to explore what Argentina has to offer! As this is our honeymoon kinda trip, we are not really looking at doing long multiple day treks (but we’re looking forward to short one-day treks). We are also not comfortable driving around. 

Would be great if you could give us inputs on: 

1. Broad itinerary covered above, and additional places which we should include.
2. Iguazu – whether we should also cover the Brazil side?
3. Whether 5 days is enough for El Calafate and El Chaltén?
4. I'm guessing we have to take flights for each place. What order should we cover the places in?

Look forward to hear from you guys. Many thanks in advance!",travel

However I’m now concerned with how long it takes.  I leave for Italy on August 27 for around 4-5 months for school.

1967,What is your weirdest travel story?,"I'll start with mine.  A few years ago I was travelling NZ solo and I had seen a flyer in our hostel for a one-man show taking place in a performance space not too far away.  I assume there wouldn't be any tickets left over, but I didn't have any other plans for that night, so I wandered over and asked the woman handing out programs if there were any available.  She frowned for a moment and said no, it was all sold out, then paused and said, ""You know what?  This is my dad's show, and I know he wants as many people to see it as possible, so just wait until everyone is seated and I'll bring you a folding chair so you can sit in the back.""  We chatted for a bit and it turned out we had the same first name (Sarah) and we really hit it off.  She was super sweet and kept her word--as soon as everyone was inside, she pulled out a chair and set me up in the back of the room.

Throughout the first half of the show, I kept thinking to myself, ""This actor looks SO familiar"" but I just couldn't place him.  Then, at the intermission, everyone stood up and stretched a bit, at which point I saw that the row in front of me sure had a lot of guys in it that also looked very, very familiar.  It hit me just as the lights dimmed that sitting in front of me was the Kiwi faction of the *The Hobbit* cast and the man on the stage was Mark Hadlow, who played Dori.  After the show, I stuck back a bit to tell Sarah thank you for being so accommodating only for her insist on introducing me to her stepdad (I think she said he was her stepdad?).  I didn't end up taking a picture with him because I was too embarrassed to ask, but I offered to take a picture for one fan and the next thing I knew, I had a line of people handing me their phones. I wound up taking pictures for various strangers for a good 15 minutes before I quietly snuck out and headed back to my hostel.

So that's my weird travel story.  What have you got?",travel

Please note that I am not stating that these facts are true, but based on articles I’ve read and photos I’ve seen, Barcelona has more social options, as in, more expansive nightlife and more opportunities to socialize and befriend others, however, the Country is not as beautiful as Croatia. I feel that Croatia’s beaches and architecture are absolutely stunning in comparison to Spain, but I’m afraid Croatia will have more “dead seasons” during the time frame I’m looking to go and I won’t be able to connect or socialize as much as I would if I was in Spain.

I will arrive in New York spend the weekend there, continue on to San Francisco and spend most of the week there, then I will continue flying up to Seattle/Portland spending the weekend in one of those city and after that fly back to LA where I will stay the week until towards the end of the week where I will take a Bus down to San Diego for the Convention. After that I will take a plane directly back to NY and from there another Plane back to Germany. (I have been in America before but both times I only stayed within the LA county.)

The only thing I haven’t figured out yet is which City to visit in Oregon/Washington. One of my friends wants to meet up with me to show me one of the 2 above mentioned Cities. She has been in both before and said that I would love either but she wants me to decide in which one we should meet up.

Russia has banned road and rail entry via Belarus which is annoying as I’ve heard the train from Poland to Moscow is great.  
We aren’t super wealthy either so maximum budget for travel would be around £250 each total (that means to get that and to get back would need to be total £500 for the 2 of us).  
Anyone ever tried getting from UK to Russia without flying? Any tips please?",travel
