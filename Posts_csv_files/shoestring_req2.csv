Question: Keeping costs low in Se Asia / when to splurge,"Hi, 

I've been travelling China for the last month, and am travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand until near the end of August. After that, I am starting an exchange in Hong Kong. I have a decent amount of money saved for my exchange and subsequent travels, but I only budgeted around 3k for my three months in Se Asia. I've been pretty good about sticking to my budget for accom/food/transport, but I did have a few of unexpected expenses including needing to buy a new camera lens because my original one was damaged (300), I had to buy an exit flight before boarding the plane to China (200) and I had to pay to expedite my Vietnamese visa before I left (which I didn't even up needing because I flew into Hanoi instead of crossing overland as planned, so I could have gone with the cheaper visa on arrival!) 

Anyway, my problem is.. I want to stick to my budget as closely as possible, which means about 20/day ish for the remainder - but I don't want to give up too many activities. So, I was wondering if people had tips for living making the most out of a small budget. Like what activities are worth splurging on (like i just did a ha long bay cruise and it was def worth it) and what cheaper activities are often overlooked (like... treks in national parks? motorbiking around rice fields?) 

So far my favourite things so far on this trip have been walking the great wall, eating street food in shanghai, hiking zhangjiajie, ha long bay (and swimming with the bioluminescent plankton), and exploring cafes in hanoi... I def lean towards like outdoorsy activities; swimming, hiking and kayaking, but i love a bit of food tourism too. 

Specifically, what do you think of the following activities:

\- diving course: is it worth the cost and where is the best place to do it for the best experience.  (vietnam? thailand?) 

\- elephant sanctuary. I def wanna see some elepahnts, but i want it to be ethical! where was your best value for money experience. I'm considering mondulkiri project in cambodia or one of the most popular sanctuaries in thailand)

\- any other activities that you think are worth splurging on  (rock climbing, ziplining, massages?) 

\- similarly, what are places worth staying at with good free activities. i'm pretty keen on the idea of staying at a good beach (or other place with good free activities?) for a week or so and just swimming / exploring / eating pineapple, so my only expenses are accommodation and food. What are the best beaches for this in Vietnam/ Cambodia/ Thai Islands? 

If you have any other suggestions for keeping costs low without sacrificing experiences, let me know! 

TL;DR: What are the activities in SE Asia that should not be sacrificed in order to save money? (and vice versa)",Shoestring
United flights USA to HongKong/Tokyo,"We have a $1000 travel voucher for United but it can only be used on United planes, so no code sharing, we would like to go to both Hong Kong and then to Tokyo and back sometime during the week of Thanksgiving 2019.

Questions for Travelers to Tokyo,"Hey, 

Me and my bro are going to Japan from July 30 to August 21. I was thinking about buying the JR pass but second guessing because of financial and useful reasons.

Keep in mind : I'm bringing 800 in cash, 3.4k in bank, and 1.1 K in credit. DB and CR have 3% FT fees.

"From NW Indiana to Denver, CO","Sorry if this isn’t the correct sub to ask this, but I was wondering if some of you could help give me some ideas for cheap places to stop along the way from Indiana to Denver or vice versa. I’m looking for things to do on the way out.

TIL an airplane is not like a bus,"So I booked a ticket from Chongqing --&gt; HongKong --&gt; JFK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having booked the ticket from Guangxi, I'd have to make my way to Chongqing to catch the flight. So I thought, I might as well just take the train to Hong Kong and catch the second flight from there. So I did. I thought I'd just walk up to the gate in HKIA and hop on the plane and nobody would care nor ask about my absence from the first flight. Well guess what? They did. 

&amp;#x200B;

So apparently it's the policy of *all airlines* that a booked ticket must be taken from the very first flight, or otherwise the rest of the trip will be automatically cancelled (it's in the small print at the end of the confirmation email). 

I'm taking full accountability here, and not posting here to bitch about the system (although, yes it would be nice if that were not the case). I just thought I'd share my experience here to prevent any naive individuals like myself from making the same mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're curious about the end of the story: after (regrettably) arguing with customer service of both the airline and Trip.com for around 30 minutes, I let it go, booked a new, cheaper, ticket from HK to JFK for later that day, accepted the partial refund for my first flight which amounted to around 40% of the ticket, and went on my way.

Anyone with experience on Panama? Bocas del Toro?,"How's it? Is it doable on a low budget? I am currently considering Panama and Nicaragua, but Nica is kinda sketchy at the moment with their whole situation.

Just back from Stockholm not the cheapest place) some tips for doing it on a budget,"1. Investing in a public transport pass is a good move. It cost £23 for 72 hours which seems quite high but the network is massive. You can even get to the archipelago on it (an island called Vaxholm) Will add it doesn't include airport but flixbus is cheap for that.
2. Last point leads on to next one, don't stay in the Old Town/City Centre choose somewhere close to a Tunnelbanna then you can save money on lodgings, plus there are usually more interesting places in the less touristy areas. I personally stayed in Sodermalm right near Skanstull and would highly recommend. It was less than 10 mins to get to Gamla Stan from there
3. Try to stay somewhere with kitchen facilities, the supermarkets are good so you can save money by making picnics. Wilys and Lidl were the cheapest ones. I think on eating/drinking out the same advice applies anywhere in the world- its always going to be way more expensive in an ultra-touristy part of the city.
4. I found quite a few bars that were not very expensive (could get a 40cl beer for under £4 ) sadly most of them did not really have the atmosphere you'd want (not awful but not great) I would however recommend Carmen on Tjärhovsgatan (Sodermalm) totally no frills but in a good way, apparently its the 1 cheap place the young cool locals go

Hopefully these tips will help somebody.",Shoestring

Couchsurfing,"Hey guys!

I have however verified, and I try to put some efforts in my requests, while also making public plans.

Advice on where/how to change my money,"I’m a little confused when it comes to changing my currency over.

The currency always confuses me and I just want to hear what some others do while traveling.

Note: I won’t be able to use my credit card everywhere. And I’ll be traveling for a few weeks, so at some point I will be using the ATMs- unless there is a better option that I am not aware of?

The bus ride from hell (Ourbus),"Good afternoon everyone, I apologize if this isn't the place to share this but since it involves me trying to travel cheaply I thought it best to give a warning. 

Today I hopped on a bus from Norfolk, VA to New York, NY with the ultimate destination being Boston, MA. Grand total? $37 USD before taxes. Score right? I booked my first bus to NY through Ourbus because they offered sokid amenities(A/C, Water, Wi-Fi and clean restroom. So I showed up and waited. The bus was maybe 5 minutes late so not to bad. I hope on and the first thing I notice is heat. Not just warm. But full pitstains hot. I try to adjust my AC vent to find that it's not blowing, it had broken. Oh well, we pop the roof vents and occasionally get some air. I ask for some water, they're out. Frustrating but I came prepared. I try to get on the Wi-Fi when we hit the rural areas. I'm sure you can guess what happened, no luck. Despite the losing 8 pounds in sweat I still have to utilize the facilities. I stepped in, backed out, and held it for 9 hours. At some point we get roughly a half hour behind. Then the driver decided to stop for a smoke break. . . for a half hour. So for a half hour we say on the oven of a bus so this guy could smoke. Ya know what. Oh well. I had an hour and 10 minute gap because I know stuff happens. Well apparently at this point he realizes we're late and begins driving very aggressively. Give you a nickel if you can guess what happens next. If you guessed he hit a car, you'd be correct. At this point I've missed my connecting bus by half an hour. And he spends another half hour fighting with this chick who was holding onto his phone until the police arrive when one of the other passengers just snatches his phone back and he leaves the scene of an accident. Goes maybe 300 yards and halfway up an exit to let passengers who are done with this off. Then crosses the double white lines back into the freeway. Another half hour and I'm finally at the stop. Now I needed to get to Boston tonight and I'll be demand if I'm getting on another bus. So I jog down to Penn station and spend $145.80 on a train ticket (that's with military discount) and pretty much just suck up the $10 loss on a Megabus ticket I didn't get to use. So I play phone tag with these guys, three calls, various IMs on their website and emails and it's not until I mention that the press should be made aware that they give me a whopping 27 dollars. . . of credit. After politely explaining that I'd rather walk from VA to NY on broken glass they said they'd look into it. Theoretically they'll get back to me by noon tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath. If there's interest I'll update this. Apologies for errors writing on mobile from a train.


TLDR: Ourbus is hands down the worst travel company on earth. I'd do anything to not have to deal with them again.

My sister told me that I can offer my seat to someone else for flying vouchers. Is this true?,"Hi I am new to this sub so sorry if this has been asked before. My sister just recently told me about something her boss does when he flies. She said that he regularly goes up to the people at the airline at the time of his flight and tells them that he is willing to volunteer his seat, and that they usually give him flying vouchers that amount to something greater than what he paid for for the flight, as well as getting put on the next flight out.

I fly somewhat regularly from NY to LA to visit my girlfriend and I was wondering if I can do this too. It honestly just sounds too good to be true and I feel like literally every person would do this if it were that easy. Anyone have any more info/experience with this?",Shoestring

What are some tips you have for saving money while doing the Pan American highway?,"Let me start off with saying, this trip is at best a couple years away, but I really enjoy the planning phases of a trip and I always love learning about new things I can use while traveling, so that’s why I’m asking so early. 

I am hoping to do the pan American highway in a Jeep Wrangler (probably a 2 door, not sure yet though) over 3 years (36 months) but if I can make my budget last I wouldn’t hesitate to stay longer and use up all of my budget on such a trip. The plan is to camp, cook my own meals when it makes sense and really not party to save money. I’m already not much into drinking and I’m not going to get involved in any sort of drugs. 

Ideally I would like to visit every country in the America’s except for Venezuela, so this includes Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. I’m really not sure what more information I can provide lol, I of course want to see all of the main attractions while I’m there but I also want to go get far away from the tourist circuit as well. 

Budget wise in my mind I’m hoping I could easily stick to 12k CAD (9k USD) per year. So far I have heard from two people that have done the pan American highway and one managed a budget of 27k USD for two years everything included (seems a bit high to me..) and another who did 3 years in 40k CAD, but he admits he splurged a few times each costing him hundreds/thousands (like his trip to Easter island, scuba diving courses I believe and Galápagos Islands) he said had he been a bit more budget conscious he thinks he could have easily done it on 12k CAD/year which is where I’m getting my estimates from primarily. 

I don’t think I’d be interested in working while there, but at the same time I could try working a bit at a hostel to save on accommodation whenever I feel like staying in a hostel and get tired of camping. 

Any ideas on how to save money on such a trip? If you’ve actually done the panamerican yourself I would greatly appreciate your responses in particular and I’d love to hear what kind of budget you managed yourself!",Shoestring

Visiting Spain for a week!,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend are planning on visiting Spain in August. We have not decided flight dates yet but it will probably be in the first weeks of the month. We're from Portugal so flight costs aren't *a big deal* (given that the flights cost around \~50€ total for each person) but we're a bit stale on what to actually visit. Our idea was to go straight to Madrid and stay there for a couple of days (perhaps even 1 or 2 more days) and then catch a train to Valencia (pictures online were marvelous). 

&amp;#x200B;

Our vacation idea isn't really a *hit the beach and relax* type of thing but we would like to mix that with visiting historic monuments (our first idea was to hit Rome but we didn't manage to make it, perhaps another time). From what I saw, I'm not really sure if Madrid is the type of city you'd want to visit in order to see monuments and such (it seems like Madrid is a commercial city, with no **big** history judging by the pictures/reviews I saw online - kinda like Milan). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nontheless, even I'm wrong and Madrid (and Valencia) **is** indeed a beautiful city to visit, I would like to get people's opinions on reserving hotel rooms online (trivago or booking are **most likely** our only options since they are the most known companies here). Is it safe given that these companies work as middle-men between you and the actual hotel? Isn't it better to straight up call the hotel and make a reservation? (is it more expensive?)

&amp;#x200B;

And what about train tickets? Is *thetrainline* website a safe place to buy them? Anything we need to take into account?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also be open to suggestions about others cities rather than the ones we planned on going. Barcelona isn't really a choice since my girlfriend has been there for 3 times now and I really don't want to make her re-visit almost everything again, perhaps on a later date.",Shoestring

Disney World or Abroad Vacation?,"My husband and I are wanting to go our our honeymoon sometime this fall. The wedding really drained our bank accounts so we've had to wait a year to save up to go somewhere, but we're still pretty low on funds. The original plan was to go to Disney because I have never been before, but I am worried that's going to still be too expensive to make work. I was told that going out of country for a honeymoon would actually be less expensive than in country so now we're considering that as well. So I'm wondering which you think would be a better deal? Disney World or Abroad somewhere nice?

&amp;#x200B;

Some other possibly important info:

We live in Kentucky

We want at least a good part of this vacation to be relaxing, not adventure based

We want to stay at least a week, possibly longer

If we go to Disney we would also want to go to Universal at least for a day

We would greatly appreciate literally any tips for either Honeymoon option

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are saying abroad, which is great and all but I also would like to know suggestions for where to travel exactly. Abroad is much more vast than Disney so I wouldn't even know where to start.

Edit 2: Some corrections: I understand the Disney Park is not relaxing. If we pick Disney we plan on spending a good amount of time on the beach or at a friends condo (that has a pool) as well as at the parks. We would also drive down seeing as Florida actually isn’t that far from us and like I said, we have a place to stay for cheap. My budget is not $1000 as assumed by a lot of people. We have about $1200 give or take saved right now but still have time to save more as well as a credit card we already have designated for travel.",Shoestring
How to Greece (5 day trip),"Me (M18) and my friend (F18) are going to Greece very soon have a couple of questions.

* should we spend more days on the mainland or Islands 
* Which Island/s should we go to. My Friend wants to go to Santorini, but I'm leaning more towards Ios, But that's only from our 2ish days of looking online, so any other suggestions are helpful.   
* How on Gods green earth does the Greek ferry system work? One source says its a cheap, 45-minute ferry to Santorini, and then another tells me it will take 8 hours and 100 euro one way, what even is consitency.   
* whats some cool things to do, both on the mainland and islands, on the cheap.

Borneo to Sulawesi... how do I do it cheap?,"Is the only way to get to Sulawesi, through a big airport (Jakarta, KL, etc?).  

 I will be in Malaysian Borneo first, and have flexibility to get to Sulawesi from any main airport there- but it seems like I can only find flights that go to Monado, Sulawesi from KL/Jakarta.  I can’t find any flights from Air Asia and the cheapest ones I can find are in the $250 Canadian dollars range.  

Is there a cheaper way overland? Say crossing the border to Kalimantan and flying from there?  Or is my best option to fly from a main airport and bite the $250 dollar bullet? I am slightly pressed for time, unfortunately.

Traveled to Barcelona and Paris things I wish I would’ve known,"So for context I travelled from my city in the US through a connected international flight to Barcelona, from Barcelona to Paris, and then back to the US through a connected flight.

**Before you leave**

* I would exchange currency in the US, go IN ADVANCE to a big bank (Chase, Wells Fargo etc...) and request it. You can lose a big percentage if you exchange at the European airport exchange place or at certain exchange places in Barcelona. I cannot stress this enough look up the reviews for the exchange places and ask what the rates are, I went to what looked like a decent place with asian ladies, and got 30% of my value ripped off and I didn’t know I got hustled until it was too late. The place also had a 1 star on google reviews...
* Pack plenty of clothes and underwear, for the guys, have plenty of shirts and cut down on pants with shorts as you can use them multiple times. Definitely pack enough socks &amp; underwear especially if you are doing a beach day or something. Good comfortable shoes, if you want to do it all, you have to walk a lot.

**Flights**

* If you’re traveling through united (economy) you’re allowed a checked in bag for free, and a carry on, plus a backpack (as long as its not gigantic).
* They weren’t checking our carry on dimension wise leaving from the US, but they will from Barcelona to Paris, don’t over do your carry on make it look as small as possible.
* This is a big one, plan for the fact that traveling in Europe won’t grant you the same luggage as traveling from the US to Europe. As in traveling from Barcelona to Paris, you’re only allowed your checked in bag, and carry on ONLY. If you have anything else, they will charge you a 60 euro fine. The fine also applies to being overweight with your checked in bag so keep that in mind.
* When traveling back to the US, you have to understand that the TSA are not nice, and to keep your snacks food, whatever in your checked in bag, and do clothes only or non-edible in your carry on to avoid any problems.
* This is something I found at the airports and it can come in handy. You’re not allowed water bottles until you reach your gate at the airport terminals. So carry an empty water bottle, or a water bottle in your carry on (backpack). They have water fountains at the Barcelona, Paris, and Newark airports, whereas a sold water will cost you at least $2.50.
* My first time flying through a connected flight, they can the gates so watch out for that.

**Barcelona**

* It was so fun 😩😩🙌😊
* Perfect if you’re a uni student and want to go have fun
* Almost everybody speaks descent English, and if you speak Spanish its even better
* The whole city is run down with American uni students, and Americans in general so literally everytime someone bumped in to me it was a “I’m sorry” never a perdon.
* Get a metro pass for the time that you will be there, also they close the metro past a certain hour but you can use the bus, show them your metro card and ride for free
* The hours are really cool, a lot of places (pinchos restaurants) open up at 10:30 pm and close at 2:30 am
* So many attractions and things to do
* Never encountered the “ciesta” maybe its not followed in Barça
* Relatively inexpensive food (1 euro pinchos), and good :)
* Relatively inexpensive drinks, also a rule in the city you can’t buy alcohol after 11pm
* What to watch out for: if people outside of a place are trying really hard to get you to go, don’t. Tables outside are cute but its not descent food, and way to expensive. There was a big plaza (or cathedral) with restaurants all around it, avoid it. The descent places will be more hidden or you can try google maps.
* I never really felt unsafe, except for that one time we got lost in shady place, but literally all the time as long if you travel with people you are 100% fine. If you’re really late lots of street vendors will come up to you and try to sell you shit which is kind of annoying.

**Paris**

* Not a party city I would say, definitely more for couples
* Subway more complicated than the one in Barça they don’t call out the stops you have to look at the walls and see the name of the stop painted to know where you are.
* Museums are really good, but make sure you have tickets for the Louvre ahead of time (get them online), and that goes for the Palace of Versailles as well, I don’t recommend the catacombs waste of time outside. Do the big museums, Eiffel tower summit, Arch (have to buy a ticket to go to rooftop again online), Versailles palace + gardens (the gardens made the trip worth it), visit Notre Dame, gardens, and walk around the museum district.
* Food A LOT more expensive and not as good as the one in Barça (expect to eat crêpes)
* Everything is just more expensive, and beer very limited, they offer rosé or white wine, free water at most restaurants unlike in Barça
* Hours for food are kind of bad, most places close at 3 pm, then open up at 7 pm and close at midnight. Past midnight everything is pretty much closed.
* English is very limited here, and locals don’t like the fact that they have to speak English, and you not French
* Holy shit I almost forgot. If you’re carrying heavy luggage don’t take a train from the airport, plan ahead it will be a nightmare. A lot of steps, not worth it.
* VALIDATE YOUR TRAIN PASS AT THE MACHINE, the machines are in French and don’t make this explicit. If you buy a 5 day subway pass, validate it by inputing it into the machine itself where it will stamp a date on it, officially validating it, if the police stop you without you doing this will be a big issue. Also get the printed receipt just in case.
* Not as safe as in Barcelona I would say, but I never felt in danger. Always be in a group when traveling especially at night, near the big attractions.

My folks told me about this site to find cheap flights,"Hey everyone!

Before i get started, I’m not at all affiliated with this site or anyone in the travel industry or anything like that. Just a really cool website to learn about cheap flights around the world. 

My folks somehow found a site that sends you emails with stupid good deals on random flights around the world. It’s called Scott’s Cheap Flights! I’ve seen deals that I’m actually able to afford (oof) 

The flights are totally random, and the window to purchase is usually pretty small, but if you’re feeling spontaneous and want to take a trip that’s usually a couple months out, it’s a really good way to save a ton on the tickets. They’re usually non refundable and sometimes don’t include bag fees, so be sure to look at the details.

Safe travels!

It's LAX to Montreal. Stop for the night. Then Montreal to Rome. Same vice versa. It includes the seat (but not luggage) for $975. My preference would have been a stop over in NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, or DC but the stop in Montreal was much cheaper.

Carry on baggage question,"Hello.

My friend and I are planning on doing a 2 week trip to Austria. We have a budget and when looking at flights, checking in baggage is too expensive (like $160 roundtrip each). We planned on just checking one bag, but now we just rather take a backpack and a carry on each.

Carry on limits, according to the website I am getting tickets from ([Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com), which gets info from the airlines, I believe), is 7 kg. The return trip is 8 kg.

I just packed my carry-on bag as if I were traveling tomorrow (without packing toiletry bag, a sweater, and little misc items like belts) and the bag weighed 7.5 kg already. We want to have our backpacks as empty as possible to pack the items we buy during the trip.

Supposing the carry on bags weigh 9 kg or 10 kg when traveling, is this going to be a big deal? How strict are airlines with this? Do they weigh the bag?

I imagine low-cost airlines may be more strict... does anyone has experience with Norweigan, XL France, Laudamotion, EuroWings, Austrian Air? Those are airlines serving the flights we are looking at.

We just want to save money and have enough for the actual trip, and I can't believe that 2 kg or 3 kg would be a reason to make us check a small bag. Also, I have had check-in people not weigh my carry-on bag before, and when they do, I have had them not care about an excess of a kilogram or two. Should I expect the same from the airlines I mentioned?

How to do Latin America in 6 months? Advice por favor...,"So, I've decided to leave the USA and go on an adventure starting in about month.

1) 31M USA

2) Speak decent level of spanish

3) Got a solid savings, but I'd prefer to keep monthly spending to around $2000 USD. 

4) Pretty open-minded. Also, in good physical condition so I'm open to outdoor stuff. 

5) I love making music and films. So I will want to bring my equipment, at least, my camera, gimbal and lenses. Trying to make a decision on baggage. 

6) Enjoy walking outside, eating street food, taking a beer/coffee. 

7) Open to staying in places for extensive periods of time. 

8) I've been in Mexico and Costa Rica recently and loved it. Although, I'd prefer to explore further south (Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Argentina...)

U.S fall vacation ideas?,"I'm hoping to take a fall (Sept-Oct) vacation with my wife later this year, but I'm not sure where to go. We are pretty flexible with the type of vacation. Big city, camping, beaches, mountains, we don't really care.  I want to stay in the US to keep the price down.

Peru (+Bolivia? Colombia?),"I tend to plan very ambitious itineraries for my trips and this time I could use some advice. I’m 1/2 Peruvian and have never been, so my family is going in January for a week. I’ve decided to go a week ahead of them, but I’m not sure how to spend the first week.

My initial thought was to travel to Bolivia to see an old friend and visit the Uyuni salt flats. Then I thought maybe Medellin because I’m also 1/2 Colombian and I’ve heard that New Years there is amazing — though, I don’t know anyone there. (I’ve already been to other Colombian cities, but never Medellin.) My third thought is that I should just take it easy and spend the full two weeks in Peru getting to know family and exploring more of the country.

The price difference isn’t huge for a multi-destination ticket and I have such little vacation time in a year that I tend to tack on as many destinations as possible, but maybe it’d be better to just do one?

Is it tacky or inappropriate to fill up a flask from the free-flowing coffee station in a restaurant?,"When we first traveled together, SO &amp; I easily spent 20e on our first day on coffee (expensive European city, horrible coffee, but coffee is life, so..). I think it's a huge waste of resources so the next few days, I suggested to just share a cup each time throughout each day. Worked out well enough, still an expense that I think we can cut down further on.

We will be traveling together again in a few weeks. We're working on a budget now and he put in 30e for coffee for three days! Que horror! Lol! I suggested that maybe we can bring a flask instead and fill it with coffee from the coffee station during the free breakfast provided by the hotel. He was aghast, to say the least. He said that it's inappropriate and that he'd walk out if I did that. He also said that people will stare and the staff may not say anything but they will certainly talk about me.

I'm just meh about it because for me it boils down to saving some that can be better spent on other things. And I rationalized it as, it's free-flowing, drink all you can anyways, so what difference does it make if you drink it there or take it with you?

Anyways.. Just wanted to ask fellow travelers' opinions.. Am I on the wrong here? Is it tacky or inappropriate?",Shoestring

We took a two-week honeymoon in Europe for $3600. Here's our budget!,"My hubby and I recently tied the knot. We're recent college grads and don't have much savings yet, so we decided to forgo a traditional wedding in favor of eloping and going on a nice honeymoon together. We managed to keep everything under $4000 USD without sacrificing our overall enjoyment of the vacation. Here's an overview of the trip:

* Origin: United States (east coat)
* Glasgow, Scotland (4 days)
* Edinburgh, Scotland (4 days)
* Dublin, Ireland (5 days)
* Reykjavik, Iceland (3 days)

And here is a breakdown of our spending over the course of 16 days (rounded for easier math):

* **Accomodations: $850.** We stayed  in AirBnB's. In most cases we had a private room with shared kitchen/living area, and in Iceland we had our own ""tiny home.""
* **Airfare: $870.** Our long-haul flights were $790 (Icelandair with a free 3-day stopover) and we also took an $80 Ryanair flight to Dublin. What really kept our cost down was not having any checked bags. We brought 40L backpacks as our carry-ons.
* **Local transport: $670.** This includes Ubers to our airport and back (cheaper than parking fees), local buses, trains for day trips and to get to Edinburgh, and our rental car in Iceland (plus insurance/gas/parking). We also took a couple of Ubers to make it easier to find our AirBnBs from the airport.
* **Food: $900.** We averaged around $55 per day. We typically just ate out one meal per day (usually lunch) and cooked everything else in our AirBnB. We both don't like to drink a lot of alcohol, so that definitely helped to keep the cost down.
* **Attractions: $240.** Personally we like to to spend most of our time exploring nature and checking out historical sites, so we avoided a lot of the pricey touristy stuff. Of course there were a few must-see sights that we paid to go to, including Edinburgh Castle, the Guiness Brewery, the Irish Whiskey Museum, and Iceland's Secret Lagoon. This also includes tips for a few free walking tours that we went on.
* **International medical insurance: $50**. Just a basic package.

**That brings our total cost to roughly $3600**. We're very happy to have come out under budget, especially when we really did not feel like we were skimping. It was definitely not a ""luxurious"" vacation but we had a ton of fun and made some lifelong memories. I'll summarize by just giving a few tips to help others save some money on their travels.

* Be flexible with your destination. We knew we wanted to fly to Europe with Icelandair to take advantage of their free stopover, but we weren't committed to a specific destination in Europe. We researched which cities were cheapest to fly into and out of, and kept our eyes peeled for good deals.
* Skip the international phone plans. We just used wifi and were completely fine. Pro tip: you can use location services without any data!
* Don't eat out too much. While food is an important part of travel, we didn't mind cooking a lot of our meals. It saved us a lot of money and also is something we enjoy doing to wind down at the end of the day.
* Take advantage of free attractions, like walking tours, hikes, museusm, etc.",Shoestring

My Favourite Five - New York,"Hey everyone. I wrote up a list a while ago of my favourite five things to do in New York, with a focus on the many free and super cheap things you can do. I thought maybe some people here might be interested and comparing notes.  Anyway, here it is below:

**My Favourite Five - New York**

New York is a pretty popular place. It is a very common place to celebrate New Years Eve there. There is lots to do, and unless you are there for a while, you can't possibly cover it all. But, you can try. So, let’s take a look at **My Favourite Five** places in New York.  


**1. American Museum of Natural History**  
Located near Central Park, this museum is huge. It has such a large variety of things to go see. There are different sections covering major groups of organisms. There is a set of mammal halls, reptile halls and a whole section on humans and their cultural evolution. Plus no visit is complete without the obligatory dinosaur section. You could literally spend hours there. Days even, if you are so inclined.  
Now here is the reason why you are reading this. For my fellow travellers who like to live on the cheap, this is the place for you. If you buy the ticket online, the cost is about 23 USD. So you don’t buy it online.  
They have a pay-what-you-like policy at the counter. So, essentially you choose how much your ticket costs. You can pay a dollar if you like or the full price or anything in between. Maybe you could even pay more, but I am not sure how many people do that. I mean, the idea is to pay what you are capable to help them maintain the massive amount of important specimens that they store. But let’s face it, when you are on the road, most days you have to decide between food and visiting a location. It is nice to visit a museum and not feel sick from the ticket price, knowing you are going to be on salt and rice for the next two weeks to maintain your budget. So, take my advice, don’t pay in advance. Save some cash. Even if you hate museums, it is a good place to go when you can't wander around due to the bad weather. So keep it on your list.  


**2. Statue of Liberty**  
When I was there, the statue was closed due to damage from a recent storm. But, you can’t go to New York and not see the thing. Not because it was particularly amazing or anything. You have to see it, so that you don’t have to spend the next 40 years explaining why you didn’t, every time New York comes up in a conversation. While travelling, you are supposed to have freedom. But sometimes small sacrifices of time and effort have to be made to protect you from crap in the future. The statue is cool, but there is so much in New York, that I would forgive you for not going seeing it.  
The easiest way is to purchase an official ticket. You can go on to the island, walk around, take photos and all that. It seems alright. With the right ticket, you can actually climb inside and hang out in the head. I had originally planned to do that myself, but couldn't use the ticket due to the storm.  
If you don’t want to pay, there is another way though. You won’t get as close and you won’t stop on the island. But if you take the free ferry to Staten Island, it will go past the statue and you can hang out and take a photo from there. You won't get super close. But it is much better than trying from the shore. If you have a good enough camera, people won’t even know that you didn’t pay. The ferry leaves from Whitehall Street. Just be cool though. The timetables are marked with yellow for the times when it is peak hour for residents returning home after a hard day at work. Try to take a ferry that does not coincide with that and you will not have to deal with the wrath of the native New Yorker. They can be pretty scary.  
Just remember, it is free. Free. Free. Free. Man, I love free stuff.  


**3. Shows. Shows. Shows.**  
Lots of those iconic variety shows that are popular on the Youtubes (that's how you spell it right?) are actually recorded in New York. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Myers, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. All interesting and worth a look. They always need an audience. You can more often than not get tickets for free. I went to see David Letterman filmed, back when he was doing his thing. It was an interesting experience to take a look behind the scenes. I never intended to go, actually. I was simply stopped by staff as I passed the building it was going to be filmed at and asked if I would like to join in. No cost? Free stuff? Sure, let me in.  
Nowadays, it seems that you can book your tickets online. There may be the ability to get tickets out the front of some of the studios, but I would try and secure a ticket online first before trying your luck elsewhere. Each show has different schedules, but have a look at the ones you are interested in and you can find the information pretty easily.  
I found [this website ](https://www.nycgo.com/articles/tv-show-tapings)that has some information, though I am unsure exactly how up to date it is. It at least gives you an idea and points you in the right direction for a lot of your favourite shows. Free. Free. Free.  


**4. Central Park**  
Another free thing? I know, right? You thought New York was going to be expensive. It is. Don’t be disillusioned. You will pay a hell of a lot of money just to sleep there. They would tax you for breathing, if they could. Food, drinks, transport are all going to add up. So, this is why I am giving you as much free options as possible. I like you. I don't want you to starve. 

New York is a big, tough town. To get anywhere, you have to fight through a mass of people and traffic. The noise can be deafening. So, to have a place where you can go and hide from all that chaos, just for a little while, is a valuable thing.  
The park is huge and it is almost impossible not to find a little spot for yourself. All around the park are some pretty nice places to visit. The Natural History Museum mentioned in part one is just one example. For you iPhone lovers out there, the Apple store is pretty near by too.  
My favourite thing to see there, was the squirrels. I had heard so much about them but never seen one in real life. It was cool to see them scattering around, jumping and climbing trees. I liked to just watch them and see where they went to. It was almost meditative.  
Anyway, if you are bored and the advertisement assault that is Time Square does not catch your fancy, then this is maybe a place for you to hang out. Plus in winter, they set up little ice skating rinks which is a nice little activity.  


**5. I’m walkin’ here!**  
I could go on with hundreds of epic locations. But the best thing about New York is that it is so big that the act of exploring is just as fun as any one location. Taking wanders through the many streets will net you a heap of cool discoveries that you would never have found. It will also give you the feeling of making your own holiday and not always just following what the top 10 on Lonely Planet say. I really recommend just putting the map in your back pocket, choosing a direction at random and walking. The temptation to look at the map will be strong, but try and hold off, just wander and see what comes your way.  
Of course, doing this at night is not recommended. But if you start from Time Square and just go from there, you can find lots of cool things. Adventure awaits you.  


**Additional:**  


As I said, there is so much going on here, so I don’t want to bombard you with too much stuff. But one piece of advice I give all people going to New York is to consider the 32 USD weekly subway ticket. New York is so big that sometimes, even with the best intentions, your feet just refuse to keep going. You try to negotiate with them, but they just won't budge. At times like this, having that ticket handy just makes life so much better. Also, the subway really is a cool experience all its own and is a pretty iconic aspect of New York. You should at least ride it once.  
Also, as I already mentioned the Central Park, I won’t do a full thing on this, but the “High Line” walking track is really nice too. Built on an old railway system, it stands well above the ground floor and can give you some nice views of the Hudson.

"2 month trip to Aomori, Japan","Long story short, I have an internship from May - July 2020 in Aomori. I will have my housing and most of my food paid for and will only have Mondays off so I will just need money for one meal a day for 2 months and some “time killing” money. 

I am looking for the best place to find cheap flights. I’ve looked at Scott’s Cheap Flights and Skyscanner and both have some good deals but I don’t know if any good deals will be available for the day I plan on leaving in May (around the second week). So I have these questions 

1) What would be the cheapest way to fly into Aomori from US (eastern)? Should I buy an international ticket from Scott’s Cheap Flights and a Japanese domestic flight to Aomori through another site?

2) From users who have gotten cheap internationals, when would be the best time to try to get cheap flights that are scheduled almost a year in advance? 

3) If I want to go to Tokyo would it be worth it to get a speed rail ticket from Aomori before I leave (around $150) or to find a cheap domestic flight (regular flights are around $275).

7 nights August trip: Havana or NYC on a budget?,"I know, two different things. Let me explain:

I'm meeting my SO for the first time (long distance relationship), she lives in the US and I live in Europe. We agreed to meet in her country or somewhere close. From my home country, I can find cheap tickets only for the cities mentioned in the title.  For NYC,we will be staying in Long Island City and not in Manhattan(will it be a bad experience?). For either Cuba or NYC, after flight tickets and accomondation, we will have 100$/day per person. We don't drink, we don't go to parties. We love beaches. We don't mind eating fast food in NYC. We like both Havana and NYC and we can't decide.

Cuba seems cheap, is it cheap though? Is the 15-18hour(for me)  trip to Cuba worth it? Or should we stick to the other option? Where will we have more fun?

Thank you!

**Edit:**

I apologize for not making it clear and confusing you, what I meant about LIC is that we will just use LIC(specifically Queens) to stay cheaper instead of staying in Manhattan, but our main interest is Manhattan.

I'm thinking,despite the fact that Cuba is cheaper,maybe we should choose NYC to avoid any troubles with the travel rescrictions?

Could you tell me what would we be able to do with that budget in NYC? We're more interested in sightseeing,shows,trips etc rather than expensive restaurants,drinking etc.

I'd love to go to Cuba but I'm trying to see if it'll be really much better than NYC because 16-18h trip x2 just for 7 nights won't be the best thing for me.

Mexico for now is impossible for me. Tickets start from 1400$ while Cuba and NY is 700-800$. Any other destinations where we'd have fun with that budget?

**Edit 2:** 

We finally decided to go to NYC and avoid any hassles with the travel restrictions in Cuba. It's also less travel time for both of us. And safer in a way, I can't imagine what happens if anything happens and we need money but can't access it. It seems that there is actually a lot to do in NYC despite our low budget.

It might not be as good as it'd be in Cuba but if everything goes well, we'll consider going in Havana in our next trip - when we will have more time to plan for it. It might not be the best choice, maybe we won't do everything we're dreaming of in NYC, but in the end we'll meet and I think that's what matters. I want to thank you all for taking the time to help us, we really appreciate it! Once again,thank you all!",Shoestring

Traveling from US to the Balkans - any advice I can get,"Hello! So I recently decided to take a trip to Europe within the next 6 months or so. I'm very interested in the Balkans,  specifically Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Apparently these countries are very affordable to travel within and I've always been interested in the area. However,  searching for plane tickets has been discouraging. It would be a while before I would actually purchase any tickets, but I'm trying to get an idea of prices and such.

Several websites either list no flights from my nearest airport (SDF in Louisville) or give prices around $3000 as the cheapest. How would you suggest searching for flights to places like this? Is it just unrealistic to expect to find round trip flights to the Balkans for less than $1000? Would I be better off focusing on more mainstream destinations like the UK, Germany, or Scandinavia? Never traveled to Europe and have next to no experience buying plane tickets so frankly any advice pertaining to travel from the US to Europe would be greatly appreciated!",Shoestring

a) head east to the Black Sea through Romania, then up to Moldova and Ukraine, or

Me and my girlfriend will be travelling to the States to work at a summer camp over summer, and we have 15 days after camp ends to travel.

This includes transport, accommodation, food, everything. We don't want to stay in expensive hotels or anything, but also don't really want dirt cheap hostels that are basically a bed and that's it. 

We have a semi-solid plan of staying in NYC the first 5 days and we are looking at Airbnbs in New Jersey so we could just get a bus/train to NYC. So far we've found ones going for around $80 a night that are still decent but not too expensive. I've also had a look at Couchsurfing and personally I don't mind doing it but my gf is a bit suspicious of staying at people's houses for free so I doubt I can convince her to do it to save money. 

But afterwards is still a bit up in the air, haven't decided when to go to DC or any other places. Are there any other cities near NYC that are cheap but still with lots to do?

(I heard driving can be a nightmare, lol) If any of these cities have any cool museums, historic landmarks, or castles. Those are the things I would be interested in checking out.

Pretty much open to any recommendations since I am trying to get an itinary going and see what kind of options are available. 

Any help is appreciated.",Shoestring
What are your favorite destinations in Asia?,"I have the whole month of August to travel and have been dying to go to Asia for a while now.

Helsinki and Stockholm on a shoestring?,"Any recommendations on free/discounted tours, museums, shows, or activities? Tips on how to best tour and eat well in these cities on a tight budget are highly appreciated! My friends and I will be be in Helsinki and Stockholm in  July and will either stay in hostels or do Airbnb. We're looking at a daily budget of 25e or less per person. Hopefully. 😬 Is that even workable or reasonable? 

Thanks in advance, kind strangers!

EDIT: I think I messed up with the composition but I meant 25e as a daily budget. When I wrote the above, I was operating on the idea that we'd already have paid for hostels/Airbnb and plane/ship tickets to Helsinki and Stockholm prior to arrival in these cities. What I meant as 25e/day/person was meals, daily transportation, entrance fees to museums, fees for walking tours, and the like.

Sorry for the confusion! 😬😊",Shoestring
Seattle to Washington DC: Spirit Airlines?,"So I saw a flight from Seattle to DC at around $180 a few days ago with Spirit airlines, but now it's around $230.

Which is cheaper? Thailand or Vietnam?,"I’ve lived in Thailand on and off for quite some time and I’ve found it to be a super cheap destination if you know what you’re doing. Going to Vietnam soon. Comparing a 3 month stay in Thailand vs. Vietnam, in general which country is cheaper?

Including visa, accommodation, local food, entertainment, etc.",Shoestring

I Made a Rookie Mistake,"Okie so I am a college student who will be traveling with my friend in the summer. I saved up for flights and airbnbs (which is currently all paid for)  but am currently working towards saving for food, transportation and other costs. My current job does not really pay a lot and I have less time to save as we leave next month. My mom said she can help to however I feel so bad for asking. 

The first mistake we made that is too late to change is that we booked the trip (Paris and London) for 17 days (15 days if travel is not included). I am terrified that I may be returning in debt due to this length and though I am financially cautious, I am worried about food and transportation costs. 

In terms of logistics we had a budget of $2,000 and have already paid $1,600 for flight, main transportation between the two cities, and airbnb. I was planning on budgeting 500$ for food, but after doing so much research I don’t know if that is sufficient. My friend and I are also planning on cooking and buying from grocery stores for most of our stay however.

The mistakes we have made thus far with planning this trip is making me wonder if my friend and I are even capable of traveling. As much as I want to cancel the trip, our flight booking company charges a fee that is almost equivalent to the flight. I am so stressed! London and Paris are two cities I have dreamed of traveling since little and I started saving up money as soon as I got a job and realized that doing a study abroad was too expensive for me. I’m a big history nerd and have been taking classes that cover the history of both countries, so it makes me sad that I am stressed to go. 

This would be my first time in Europe so I have no idea what to expect. I don’t know what to do? Should I cancel the trip? 

Something that I probably should look forward to and enjoy has been stressing me out to the point that I get dizzy and want to vomit. Any advice on what I should do?",Shoestring
Any good road-tripping tips?,"I wanna hit a road trip with a couple buddies toward the end of the summer along the U.S. West Coast. I've just gotten a new car and we'll just fold the seats down and sleep in the back. Anyone know if it's cool to go to campgrounds and set up for dinner, or stay the night at rest stops, etc.? Also, anyone know some cool, relatively cheap tourist destinations along Washington, Oregon, and Cali?",Shoestring
"Going to Montreal this summer, ideas for cheap/free things to do?","I’m going to Montreal for the first time with my SO the week of July 22-27! Very excited! Now we want to plan activities and things to see and do. Please suggest cheap or free events, museums, or activities! 

Cheap to me would be under $20USD",Shoestring

I'm going to France in June and I can't decide if I can just buy an outlet converter or if I'll also need a voltage converter. Everything else I'm bringing is rated for 240v.",Shoestring

Tips for travelling to US cities on a small budget (Chicago),"Hey everyone! I’ve always been interested in travelling and seeing new places but haven’t really been able to for various reasons. Long story short, I have a car now and some money so I figured I might try to take a weekend trip to a new city. I’m thinking of driving about 7 hours to either Chicago or New York (probably Chicago). Obviously gas won’t be cheap, so I’d like to keep the cost of where to stay pretty low. Considering that I just graduated high shcool and am going to college next year, I don’t really have a lot of money to go all out with any potential trips. I’m very unfamiliar with planning this type of stuff. Is AirBnB the way to go? Hostels? And any tips on how to find the best deals without staying somewhere completely sketchy?


Besides where to stay, I imagine I’d be fine on money. Im mainly into history and architecture so I could probably do a lot of self guided tours and such. But yeah if anyone has any suggestions regarding how to make where to stay affordable, that would be great! Thanks!",Shoestring
Golden Pass route questions - Switzerland,"hello - i’ll be in Switzerland in august and want to understand how the train system works there.   read a ton of stuff online, but got more confused each time.

my itinerary: flying into Zurich then headed to Lucerne.  then take the golden pass route to Montreux via Interlaken and Zweisimmen and end up in Geneva. 

i don’t have to take the fancy Golden Pass train as i understand other local/regional trains also use the same route for cheaper and i’m totally fine with that.

Seeking suggestions for towns to visit between Paris and Barcelona in October,"I'm flying into Paris and out of Barcelona 15 days later. I plan on traveling by train and making 2, maybe 3 stops along the way. I've heard good things about Toulouse, and I was considering a coastal city for my other stop but I'm not sure if it'd be worthwhile considering that it'll be the off season. I was intending to spend most of my time in France because I speak French, but I'd be willing to try a second city in Spain if it seemed promising. I haven't spent much time abroad, so I'm pretty open to suggestions and/or advice. The only thing I've booked so far are the flights, so I have a lot of flexibility.",Shoestring

Hi, r/shoestring!

First off, massive thank you to the mods for allowing me to post this.

I mod over at r/solotravel and we'd like to invite you to an upcoming AMA with Alex from [Lost with Purpose] (https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/) taking place this Saturday, May 18th! Alex has been budget-traveling around the world for a few years, hitting up all sorts of amazing places like Afghanistan, India, and Iran. This weekend, she'll be joining us from Northern Pakistan, where she's currently motorbiking through the mountains!

Here's her introduction:

---

&gt; Hey y'all! I'm Alex, a 28-year-old American solo female traveler and the creative brain behind [Lost With Purpose travel blog](https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/).

&gt; For the last three-ish years I've been backpacking full time, often roaming through countries people warned me to be well wary of such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. People often think I'm either A) crazy or B) a member of ISIS but I assure you only A is true.

&gt; In the last three years I traveled through: Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The whole world calls to me, but I have a special place in my heart (and passport) for South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan where together I've spent more than a year and a half in total.

&gt; During the last few years I've scaled ancient fortresses, seen gods dance, and road tripped across deserts. Overland travel is my MO; I've taken every kind of public transport under the sun from camping on floors of ferries to hitching rides with army convoys. While traveling I've gone through a breakup, lost family and friends, and fell in love when I least wanted it. I've eaten a million different kinds of street food by now, and had about as many bouts of diarrhea (I find it strangely satisfying at this point). I braved gynecological adventures in patriarchal India, and was saved from a foul and watery doom in a clinic in Afghanistan. Just last year I learned to motorbike in the chaotic traffic of Pakistan, and worked as a photographer for an organization helping refugees in Thailand. Let's just say I've been around the block.

&gt; At this point, I love to share about my travels in the hopes of inspiring and helping others to travel, as well as smashing stereotypes about the countries I visit. Oh, and of course it's always fun to prove that girls can get to some crazy places in this world, too.

&gt; Get at me with your questions! No thought is too silly, no inquiry too freaky. I think.

---

We're taking questions at the main thread over [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/bnrcub/announcement_upcoming_ama_with_alex_from_lost/) for those who aren't sure they'll be able to make the AMA in real time.

Hope to see you all over there!",Shoestring

What long term trips have you taken?,"I plan to be between jobs this summer and have a month or two long mental health break to travel and relax. I'll have money to travel but I've never been outside of north america before. Any recommendations for low cost of living locations - maybe even some that might not be on a top 10 list from Google search results? I've read most of the SEA countries are the way to go for low cost, high luxury trips but summer also doesn't seem like the best time to visit Thailand, Vietnam, etc. I would love to hear where you all have traveled for a month or more, what your experience was like, and what the cost per day/week/month/however you break down cost was.",Shoestring

Madrid 2 days

Crappy Three Day Trip Concepts?,"Hi everyone,

This is sort of hard to explain, but I’m middle-aged, I’ve got this middle-aged close friend/business partner, and about every six months we take a “crappy weekend trips” together. The idea is: one plans it, the other one doesn’t know what it’s going to be, and we head out for....a Pretty Crappy Experience Which In Hindsight Is Also Pretty Funny. Not necessarily “physically demanding” (though maybe?); not “particularly dangerous (but certainly not we’ll planned!); never “fun”. 

I’m up in about 2 months and to be honest: I’m low on ideas. Any chance a few of you want to kick around concepts for Crappy Weekends For Two Guys Who Love Spending Not-Great Times together?",Shoestring
