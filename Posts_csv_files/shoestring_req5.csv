NYC mid Feb - suggestions for stuff to do,"Hi Guys!

We snagged some tickets from Vancouver to NYC for Feb long weekend (get in 16th 6am - 18th 8pm). We get free accom with a family member (same age, good friends) who has an apartment somewhere on the Jersey side of the river facing Manhatten. It sounds like a pretty shwanky place. We are trying to take advantage of it whenever we can while his job has him posted there since he is on a working visa so you never know if the company will ship him somewhere else. 

We've always wanted to see New York in the snow, it looks so beautiful, and even if we don't get any snow (which at this stage doesn't seem too likely) it's just beautiful city in the cold (we've been in November for Macy's Thanksgiving, but it wasn't in the negatives). We love the cold.

We've been to NYC staying in lower Manhattan and upper west side a few times before. We've knocked out the standard tourist stuff like the site seeing booklet. We've done some weird stuff like Kenny Kramer tour. We've done a bunch of comedy clubs like Fat Black and underground (I keep forgetting if those are the same thing). We've hung out in the trendy Brooklyn bars and love Dumbo (the Pizza!!). We've walked over a lot of bridges. We've hung out on Coney Island for a day. We've discovered some small bars that seemed impossible the find (like accidentally finding a speak easy through the back of a barber shop? wtf?).

EDIT: Stayed in The Roosevelt. Walked all through central park, even watched an eclipse from the park. Liberty Island, Ellis Island. EDIT: Stayed Upper West Side fancy apartment. Broadway Musical (Aladdin).

When we go somewhere we make sure we have no lazy days so we've knocked over a lot of stuff.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on something we should try! I know you guys always find random things to do on the cheap. Any cool areas of Jersey to check out? Also best way to get from JFK to Jersey? Unfortunately JFK was the best timing on direct flights that didnt eat into either the weekend or work. Also partner's birthday, so any thoughts of something unique there would be cool too :)

Thanks! We're really excited!",Shoestring

Looking for a mini getaway trip.,"You’re traveling with your SO this Fall and have never been outside of NM, TX and LA. He enjoys driving, so a road trip could be fun, but don’t want more than 1 days worth.  

A healthy mixture of the nature scene (maybe something adventurous like jumping out of a helicopter, paragliding anything to give you an adrenaline rush), but also enjoy the night life so can’t be too far away (Maybe not more than 45 mins) from city night life. 

Here’s what you have to work with...
People: 2
Duration: 3-5 days 
Season: fall (early September to late December)
Budget: $1000-$2500 shared expenses


Is it best to rent a hotel, airbnb or camp through the getaway?

Emergency travel - Standby ticket?,"Hi everyone,

My little sister was involved in a car accident across the country. I need to get there as soon as possible but flights are around $500 and I can't afford that. Are there any cheaper options for same-day or next-day travel? I can wait around the airport if need be. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: route is ATL to MSP

Edit 2: I called Delta, JetBlue, American and United. Everyone except delta said they don’t offer a bereavement fare and Delta said I was eligible for their bereavement fare but quoted me $1,968 when the online fare for the same flights runs at $551.

Airlines Cracking Down on Carry-On Bag Sizes?,Just got stopped while I was checking in at a kiosk by an AA employee.

Amsterdam,"Hiya,  


I don't normally do the more normal travell-y stuff (I hitchhike and camp in more rural places, don't spend much time in cities), so this sort of planning is out of my league. I'm meeting a few friends I haven't seen for years, and won't see for a while again in Amsterdam for 4 days in August. I wanted to spend more time in Amsterdam for a first visit, and suggested somewhere, but one of them has dreamed of going there since they were a child, so fair play to that.   


I'm not used to figuring out where to stay as a tourist. There's loads of options on airbnb and hostelworld, but it's a little overwhelming figuring out where is a good location. Personally I'd like to get out of amsterdam a bit, everyone says to make sure you see outside the center. So would it be sensible to stay somewhere cheaper out of the center? If it's no more than an hour to commute into the city, that might be acceptable for the others in a group. And it might make our costs better.. trying to keep things under £20 a night each for a bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on a nice area to look for accomodation that's not going to be a nightmare to get into the center to do the more typical attractions my friend will be interested in?

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30 is better than ""Late July""

Question: Keeping costs low in Se Asia / when to splurge,"Hi, 

I've been travelling China for the last month, and am travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand until near the end of August. After that, I am starting an exchange in Hong Kong. I have a decent amount of money saved for my exchange and subsequent travels, but I only budgeted around 3k for my three months in Se Asia. I've been pretty good about sticking to my budget for accom/food/transport, but I did have a few of unexpected expenses including needing to buy a new camera lens because my original one was damaged (300), I had to buy an exit flight before boarding the plane to China (200) and I had to pay to expedite my Vietnamese visa before I left (which I didn't even up needing because I flew into Hanoi instead of crossing overland as planned, so I could have gone with the cheaper visa on arrival!) 

Anyway, my problem is.. I want to stick to my budget as closely as possible, which means about 20/day ish for the remainder - but I don't want to give up too many activities. So, I was wondering if people had tips for living making the most out of a small budget. Like what activities are worth splurging on (like i just did a ha long bay cruise and it was def worth it) and what cheaper activities are often overlooked (like... treks in national parks? motorbiking around rice fields?) 

So far my favourite things so far on this trip have been walking the great wall, eating street food in shanghai, hiking zhangjiajie, ha long bay (and swimming with the bioluminescent plankton), and exploring cafes in hanoi... I def lean towards like outdoorsy activities; swimming, hiking and kayaking, but i love a bit of food tourism too. 

Specifically, what do you think of the following activities:

\- diving course: is it worth the cost and where is the best place to do it for the best experience.  (vietnam? thailand?) 

\- elephant sanctuary. I def wanna see some elepahnts, but i want it to be ethical! where was your best value for money experience. I'm considering mondulkiri project in cambodia or one of the most popular sanctuaries in thailand)

\- any other activities that you think are worth splurging on  (rock climbing, ziplining, massages?) 

\- similarly, what are places worth staying at with good free activities. i'm pretty keen on the idea of staying at a good beach (or other place with good free activities?) for a week or so and just swimming / exploring / eating pineapple, so my only expenses are accommodation and food. What are the best beaches for this in Vietnam/ Cambodia/ Thai Islands? 

If you have any other suggestions for keeping costs low without sacrificing experiences, let me know! 

TL;DR: What are the activities in SE Asia that should not be sacrificed in order to save money? (and vice versa)",Shoestring

&amp;#x200B;

So apparently it's the policy of *all airlines* that a booked ticket must be taken from the very first flight, or otherwise the rest of the trip will be automatically cancelled (it's in the small print at the end of the confirmation email). 

I'm taking full accountability here, and not posting here to bitch about the system (although, yes it would be nice if that were not the case). I just thought I'd share my experience here to prevent any naive individuals like myself from making the same mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're curious about the end of the story: after (regrettably) arguing with customer service of both the airline and Trip.com for around 30 minutes, I let it go, booked a new, cheaper, ticket from HK to JFK for later that day, accepted the partial refund for my first flight which amounted to around 40% of the ticket, and went on my way.

Just back from Stockholm not the cheapest place) some tips for doing it on a budget,"1. Investing in a public transport pass is a good move. It cost £23 for 72 hours which seems quite high but the network is massive. You can even get to the archipelago on it (an island called Vaxholm) Will add it doesn't include airport but flixbus is cheap for that.
2. Last point leads on to next one, don't stay in the Old Town/City Centre choose somewhere close to a Tunnelbanna then you can save money on lodgings, plus there are usually more interesting places in the less touristy areas. I personally stayed in Sodermalm right near Skanstull and would highly recommend. It was less than 10 mins to get to Gamla Stan from there
3. Try to stay somewhere with kitchen facilities, the supermarkets are good so you can save money by making picnics. Wilys and Lidl were the cheapest ones. I think on eating/drinking out the same advice applies anywhere in the world- its always going to be way more expensive in an ultra-touristy part of the city.
4. I found quite a few bars that were not very expensive (could get a 40cl beer for under £4 ) sadly most of them did not really have the atmosphere you'd want (not awful but not great) I would however recommend Carmen on Tjärhovsgatan (Sodermalm) totally no frills but in a good way, apparently its the 1 cheap place the young cool locals go

The bus ride from hell (Ourbus),"Good afternoon everyone, I apologize if this isn't the place to share this but since it involves me trying to travel cheaply I thought it best to give a warning. 

Today I hopped on a bus from Norfolk, VA to New York, NY with the ultimate destination being Boston, MA. Grand total? $37 USD before taxes. Score right? I booked my first bus to NY through Ourbus because they offered sokid amenities(A/C, Water, Wi-Fi and clean restroom. So I showed up and waited. The bus was maybe 5 minutes late so not to bad. I hope on and the first thing I notice is heat. Not just warm. But full pitstains hot. I try to adjust my AC vent to find that it's not blowing, it had broken. Oh well, we pop the roof vents and occasionally get some air. I ask for some water, they're out. Frustrating but I came prepared. I try to get on the Wi-Fi when we hit the rural areas. I'm sure you can guess what happened, no luck. Despite the losing 8 pounds in sweat I still have to utilize the facilities. I stepped in, backed out, and held it for 9 hours. At some point we get roughly a half hour behind. Then the driver decided to stop for a smoke break. . . for a half hour. So for a half hour we say on the oven of a bus so this guy could smoke. Ya know what. Oh well. I had an hour and 10 minute gap because I know stuff happens. Well apparently at this point he realizes we're late and begins driving very aggressively. Give you a nickel if you can guess what happens next. If you guessed he hit a car, you'd be correct. At this point I've missed my connecting bus by half an hour. And he spends another half hour fighting with this chick who was holding onto his phone until the police arrive when one of the other passengers just snatches his phone back and he leaves the scene of an accident. Goes maybe 300 yards and halfway up an exit to let passengers who are done with this off. Then crosses the double white lines back into the freeway. Another half hour and I'm finally at the stop. Now I needed to get to Boston tonight and I'll be demand if I'm getting on another bus. So I jog down to Penn station and spend $145.80 on a train ticket (that's with military discount) and pretty much just suck up the $10 loss on a Megabus ticket I didn't get to use. So I play phone tag with these guys, three calls, various IMs on their website and emails and it's not until I mention that the press should be made aware that they give me a whopping 27 dollars. . . of credit. After politely explaining that I'd rather walk from VA to NY on broken glass they said they'd look into it. Theoretically they'll get back to me by noon tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath. If there's interest I'll update this. Apologies for errors writing on mobile from a train.


TLDR: Ourbus is hands down the worst travel company on earth. I'd do anything to not have to deal with them again.

What are some tips you have for saving money while doing the Pan American highway?,"Let me start off with saying, this trip is at best a couple years away, but I really enjoy the planning phases of a trip and I always love learning about new things I can use while traveling, so that’s why I’m asking so early. 

I am hoping to do the pan American highway in a Jeep Wrangler (probably a 2 door, not sure yet though) over 3 years (36 months) but if I can make my budget last I wouldn’t hesitate to stay longer and use up all of my budget on such a trip. The plan is to camp, cook my own meals when it makes sense and really not party to save money. I’m already not much into drinking and I’m not going to get involved in any sort of drugs. 

Ideally I would like to visit every country in the America’s except for Venezuela, so this includes Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. I’m really not sure what more information I can provide lol, I of course want to see all of the main attractions while I’m there but I also want to go get far away from the tourist circuit as well. 

Budget wise in my mind I’m hoping I could easily stick to 12k CAD (9k USD) per year. So far I have heard from two people that have done the pan American highway and one managed a budget of 27k USD for two years everything included (seems a bit high to me..) and another who did 3 years in 40k CAD, but he admits he splurged a few times each costing him hundreds/thousands (like his trip to Easter island, scuba diving courses I believe and Galápagos Islands) he said had he been a bit more budget conscious he thinks he could have easily done it on 12k CAD/year which is where I’m getting my estimates from primarily. 

I don’t think I’d be interested in working while there, but at the same time I could try working a bit at a hostel to save on accommodation whenever I feel like staying in a hostel and get tired of camping. 

Any ideas on how to save money on such a trip? If you’ve actually done the panamerican yourself I would greatly appreciate your responses in particular and I’d love to hear what kind of budget you managed yourself!",Shoestring

Visiting Spain for a week!,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend are planning on visiting Spain in August. We have not decided flight dates yet but it will probably be in the first weeks of the month. We're from Portugal so flight costs aren't *a big deal* (given that the flights cost around \~50€ total for each person) but we're a bit stale on what to actually visit. Our idea was to go straight to Madrid and stay there for a couple of days (perhaps even 1 or 2 more days) and then catch a train to Valencia (pictures online were marvelous). 

&amp;#x200B;

Our vacation idea isn't really a *hit the beach and relax* type of thing but we would like to mix that with visiting historic monuments (our first idea was to hit Rome but we didn't manage to make it, perhaps another time). From what I saw, I'm not really sure if Madrid is the type of city you'd want to visit in order to see monuments and such (it seems like Madrid is a commercial city, with no **big** history judging by the pictures/reviews I saw online - kinda like Milan). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nontheless, even I'm wrong and Madrid (and Valencia) **is** indeed a beautiful city to visit, I would like to get people's opinions on reserving hotel rooms online (trivago or booking are **most likely** our only options since they are the most known companies here). Is it safe given that these companies work as middle-men between you and the actual hotel? Isn't it better to straight up call the hotel and make a reservation? (is it more expensive?)

&amp;#x200B;

And what about train tickets? Is *thetrainline* website a safe place to buy them? Anything we need to take into account?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also be open to suggestions about others cities rather than the ones we planned on going. Barcelona isn't really a choice since my girlfriend has been there for 3 times now and I really don't want to make her re-visit almost everything again, perhaps on a later date.",Shoestring

Disney World or Abroad Vacation?,"My husband and I are wanting to go our our honeymoon sometime this fall. The wedding really drained our bank accounts so we've had to wait a year to save up to go somewhere, but we're still pretty low on funds. The original plan was to go to Disney because I have never been before, but I am worried that's going to still be too expensive to make work. I was told that going out of country for a honeymoon would actually be less expensive than in country so now we're considering that as well. So I'm wondering which you think would be a better deal? Disney World or Abroad somewhere nice?

&amp;#x200B;

Some other possibly important info:

We live in Kentucky

We want at least a good part of this vacation to be relaxing, not adventure based

We want to stay at least a week, possibly longer

If we go to Disney we would also want to go to Universal at least for a day

We would greatly appreciate literally any tips for either Honeymoon option

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are saying abroad, which is great and all but I also would like to know suggestions for where to travel exactly. Abroad is much more vast than Disney so I wouldn't even know where to start.

Edit 2: Some corrections: I understand the Disney Park is not relaxing. If we pick Disney we plan on spending a good amount of time on the beach or at a friends condo (that has a pool) as well as at the parks. We would also drive down seeing as Florida actually isn’t that far from us and like I said, we have a place to stay for cheap. My budget is not $1000 as assumed by a lot of people. We have about $1200 give or take saved right now but still have time to save more as well as a credit card we already have designated for travel.",Shoestring
How to Greece (5 day trip),"Me (M18) and my friend (F18) are going to Greece very soon have a couple of questions. We're staying there for five days and want to split that between the mainlands and islands three days two days. Given money is a significant factor, I have the following questions.    

* should we spend more days on the mainland or Islands 
* Which Island/s should we go to. My Friend wants to go to Santorini, but I'm leaning more towards Ios, But that's only from our 2ish days of looking online, so any other suggestions are helpful.   
* How on Gods green earth does the Greek ferry system work? One source says its a cheap, 45-minute ferry to Santorini, and then another tells me it will take 8 hours and 100 euro one way, what even is consitency.   
* whats some cool things to do, both on the mainland and islands, on the cheap.

Borneo to Sulawesi... how do I do it cheap?,"Is the only way to get to Sulawesi, through a big airport (Jakarta, KL, etc?).  

 I will be in Malaysian Borneo first, and have flexibility to get to Sulawesi from any main airport there- but it seems like I can only find flights that go to Monado, Sulawesi from KL/Jakarta.  I can’t find any flights from Air Asia and the cheapest ones I can find are in the $250 Canadian dollars range.  

Is there a cheaper way overland? Say crossing the border to Kalimantan and flying from there?  Or is my best option to fly from a main airport and bite the $250 dollar bullet? I am slightly pressed for time, unfortunately.

Traveled to Barcelona and Paris things I wish I would’ve known,"So for context I travelled from my city in the US through a connected international flight to Barcelona, from Barcelona to Paris, and then back to the US through a connected flight.

**Before you leave**

* I would exchange currency in the US, go IN ADVANCE to a big bank (Chase, Wells Fargo etc...) and request it. You can lose a big percentage if you exchange at the European airport exchange place or at certain exchange places in Barcelona. I cannot stress this enough look up the reviews for the exchange places and ask what the rates are, I went to what looked like a decent place with asian ladies, and got 30% of my value ripped off and I didn’t know I got hustled until it was too late. The place also had a 1 star on google reviews...
* Pack plenty of clothes and underwear, for the guys, have plenty of shirts and cut down on pants with shorts as you can use them multiple times. Definitely pack enough socks &amp; underwear especially if you are doing a beach day or something. Good comfortable shoes, if you want to do it all, you have to walk a lot.

**Flights**

* If you’re traveling through united (economy) you’re allowed a checked in bag for free, and a carry on, plus a backpack (as long as its not gigantic).
* They weren’t checking our carry on dimension wise leaving from the US, but they will from Barcelona to Paris, don’t over do your carry on make it look as small as possible.
* This is a big one, plan for the fact that traveling in Europe won’t grant you the same luggage as traveling from the US to Europe. As in traveling from Barcelona to Paris, you’re only allowed your checked in bag, and carry on ONLY. If you have anything else, they will charge you a 60 euro fine. The fine also applies to being overweight with your checked in bag so keep that in mind.
* When traveling back to the US, you have to understand that the TSA are not nice, and to keep your snacks food, whatever in your checked in bag, and do clothes only or non-edible in your carry on to avoid any problems.
* This is something I found at the airports and it can come in handy. You’re not allowed water bottles until you reach your gate at the airport terminals. So carry an empty water bottle, or a water bottle in your carry on (backpack). They have water fountains at the Barcelona, Paris, and Newark airports, whereas a sold water will cost you at least $2.50.
* My first time flying through a connected flight, they can the gates so watch out for that.

**Barcelona**

* It was so fun 😩😩🙌😊
* Perfect if you’re a uni student and want to go have fun
* Almost everybody speaks descent English, and if you speak Spanish its even better
* The whole city is run down with American uni students, and Americans in general so literally everytime someone bumped in to me it was a “I’m sorry” never a perdon.
* Get a metro pass for the time that you will be there, also they close the metro past a certain hour but you can use the bus, show them your metro card and ride for free
* The hours are really cool, a lot of places (pinchos restaurants) open up at 10:30 pm and close at 2:30 am
* So many attractions and things to do
* Never encountered the “ciesta” maybe its not followed in Barça
* Relatively inexpensive food (1 euro pinchos), and good :)
* Relatively inexpensive drinks, also a rule in the city you can’t buy alcohol after 11pm
* What to watch out for: if people outside of a place are trying really hard to get you to go, don’t. Tables outside are cute but its not descent food, and way to expensive. There was a big plaza (or cathedral) with restaurants all around it, avoid it. The descent places will be more hidden or you can try google maps.
* I never really felt unsafe, except for that one time we got lost in shady place, but literally all the time as long if you travel with people you are 100% fine. If you’re really late lots of street vendors will come up to you and try to sell you shit which is kind of annoying.

**Paris**

* Not a party city I would say, definitely more for couples
* Subway more complicated than the one in Barça they don’t call out the stops you have to look at the walls and see the name of the stop painted to know where you are.
* Museums are really good, but make sure you have tickets for the Louvre ahead of time (get them online), and that goes for the Palace of Versailles as well, I don’t recommend the catacombs waste of time outside. Do the big museums, Eiffel tower summit, Arch (have to buy a ticket to go to rooftop again online), Versailles palace + gardens (the gardens made the trip worth it), visit Notre Dame, gardens, and walk around the museum district.
* Food A LOT more expensive and not as good as the one in Barça (expect to eat crêpes)
* Everything is just more expensive, and beer very limited, they offer rosé or white wine, free water at most restaurants unlike in Barça
* Hours for food are kind of bad, most places close at 3 pm, then open up at 7 pm and close at midnight. Past midnight everything is pretty much closed.
* English is very limited here, and locals don’t like the fact that they have to speak English, and you not French
* Holy shit I almost forgot. If you’re carrying heavy luggage don’t take a train from the airport, plan ahead it will be a nightmare. A lot of steps, not worth it.
* VALIDATE YOUR TRAIN PASS AT THE MACHINE, the machines are in French and don’t make this explicit. If you buy a 5 day subway pass, validate it by inputing it into the machine itself where it will stamp a date on it, officially validating it, if the police stop you without you doing this will be a big issue. Also get the printed receipt just in case.
* Not as safe as in Barcelona I would say, but I never felt in danger. Always be in a group when traveling especially at night, near the big attractions.
