Chilean Patagonia advicr,"My husband and I are heading off backpacking for a year in September and plan to be in Patagonia beginning of March 2020. We intent to hike the O trail before heading to El Calafete. I've been doing some research on the booking system for the O trail and although it is confusing I think I've got my head around it. My question is, how far in advance should we be looking to reserve a spot at the campsites? When booking a spot, the option is there for food. We plan to bring our own lunches and breakfasts but maybe not enough for 8 days and would like to eat dinner at the refugios where we can, should we book this with our camping spot? Thanks in advance for any advice!",travel

NEXUS and Canadian Border Crossing,"Driving from Montana into Alberta (Chief Mountain crossing), there's no NEXUS lane. We handed our NEXUS cards and passports to the officer, but he barely glanced at the cards and handed them back immediately. He proceeded to grill us for around 10-15 minutes -- including asking to see hotel confirmation emails, questions about our route through and out of Canada, repeating questions, etc. He finally gave back our passports and let us enter, but he was starting to make us worry a bit. 

I know 10 minutes isn't horrific compared to what some people endure, but I travel frequently and it was the most intense questioning I've had from a border official outside of China (and that was because they didn't think I looked enough like my decade-old passport photo!).

I thought NEXUS was supposed to be expedited screening, even where there isn't automated processing. He seemed to totally ignore them. Is there something we should have done differently? Or was it just a slow night at the crossing?",travel

Traveled through Italy in 3 weeks,"It was November 3rd when I flew out of Laguardia to Milan. The flight was a good 7 and 1/2 hours long, but 4 movies just about covered it.  We landed in Milan with our 12 bags of luggage and headed for the busy subway. As we reached the platform we pushed out way onto the train. During the ride my mom almost got pickpocketed by some teenage girl, but the bad ass she is she slapped Dat bit*h and grabbed her purse. That was the most exciting part of the first day. 

We stayed in an Air BnB for 6 days. The BnB was located 20 feet away from a train terminal and several ""breakfast shops""(really means espresso, café, fruit, and maybe some toast.  During lunch these shops would have the most amazing prosciutto sandwiches that just melt in your mouth. 

On our first day my family and I all woke up jetlagged as fuk, but carried on because when In rome( not Rome) you can't let jetlag beat you.  Although it took about an hour and a half for everyone to get ready we were good, ready to take on the county of Italy. 

Our trip lasted 3 weeks and within those 3 week i went from Milan, to Venice. When we stayed in Rome we visited the beautiful country of Vatican City (When in Rome)! Venice through Bologna to Florence. In the mountain regions of Tuscany, Pisa, and Assisi Umbria, the trip was almost done. For the last week we spent one day in the lovely toen of Salerno, and then hit the Amalfi Coast for the most amazing 6 days of my life. 

Sorry this is my first post, and I just wanted to start some discussion on awesome trips that you took. If anyone is considering traveling to Italy I'll answer as many questions as I can!

Europe on a budget?,"We are planning some home renovations for next year but would also love to do a small Europe trip (about four countries in a two week span) in September 2020. What are some recommendations for keeping a trip low-cost for a family of three?

Edit: We’ve done a large Euro trip before. 7 countries in 26 days, wouldn’t recommend it but still had a great experience. I know four countries is a lot in 24 days, that’s why I’m asking for advice.

Possible problems traveling to the US from Canada with a one-way ticket?,"For some context:

I'm in a long distance relationship with my fiance whose mother is terminally ill and has anywhere from weeks to months left to live. Of course, her situation may deteriorate very quickly in the span of a few days - anything can happen - so I have no clue when she will pass. Obvious enough; but on that note, I want to be there for her and my fiance during this time, throughout her end-of-life days and thereafter. 

And so, without knowing exact dates, it seems pointless to book a return flight for a day I can only blindly pick. I know legally it's not required to gain entry, but ultimately my admission is under the discretion of the border official(s). I realize this may cause issues at the border once I arrive, so what can I do to prepare for any questions if I do go this route? Or is it even worth the risk? I should add I may be leaving my job prior to my trip, (with every intention of finding another once I return) which may bring up an unwanted red flag with border officials concerned about ties to my home country/financial details.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm anxious and frustrated over this and want to make sure I make it there in time, for one, and smoothly. I've only ever traveled to the US round trip so this is something I'm very unsure about. 

Thanks!",travel
Dreading US Customs,"Hello people.

3. Guessing would need to read the companys policies for what i am allowed on board, in to the US? Would be cleaning products and a bottle of water. (Store bought unopened)

Percentage of annual income/budget spent on travel,"Hi folks,

I’m just curious as to what % of your annual budgets you all spend on travel and if there’s any trends to be spotted within the r/travel community. I’m an accountant by trade and was a bit shocked today when I realised that this year I have/will be spending 13.5% of my gross annual income on my various trips. I can afford this and it is my primary hobby/interest but I still surprised myself. My income has increased by roughly 40% over the last 4 years but the percentage spent on travel has always been about the 12/13% mark so in theory my spend now should be lower but I seem to have the travel version of lifestyle inflation. My trips in the last few years have been to further destinations but also with nicer accommodation and I’ve been more likely to do expensive activities eg a hot air balloon ride. 

Have you noticed any trends like this in your own travel and how do you feel about it? Sometimes I sense a bit of judgement from family/friends/coworkers as to many people travel is seen as such a luxury so sometimes I feel a bit guilty/embarrassed about my spending but it really is the only hobby I’m really passionate about!

Edit - just wanted to update that the amount spent is about 20% of my take home pay (post tax) if that makes comparisons easier.",travel

California /Arizona Roadtrip 2 Weeks in Feb 2020. What should we visit and what should we skip.,"Hey there guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

We (me 31M and my wife 27F) are planing to go for a 2 week vacation to California. This is our first time in US so we are not quite sure which way should we go and what is most important/interesting things to see. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some info about us:** 

* We are from Europe. From Lithuania to be exact. Now living in Germany. 
* Normally we like Nature more than the Cities
* Our goal is to do a ''real American'' road trip you see in a movies. (driving the roads with no cars at all, sleeping in small hotels by the highway, etc)
* We also don't want to spend very much money. I Didn't think about our exact budget yet, but for sure we are not planing to eat in fancy restaurants, go clubbing, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Map Explanations:** 

* First picture below is based on our preferences what we think we need to see. As Grand Canyon is ''must'' for us. Would you add something or delete from the map? 
* Second picture is what I found googling about ''perfect road trip in California''  Which one would you prefer? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions and concerns:** 

* I would easily skip San Francisco, however I would really want to visit Yosmite National Park. On the other hand the weather should be bad there in Feb and it will take too much of driving. Not sure if we should just skip it. Thoughts? 
* We are planing to stay 1,5 days in Hollywood once we arrive and approx 2 last days of our stay in Venice beach. I did read that quite a lot of people are saying that 2 days in LA is enough as the city is nothing special at all. Is that right? I was under the impression, that we need to spend as much time as possible there as the city is huge and offers a lot to see and do. Any opinions?  
*  I was thinking to rent a car only for the road trip and use public transportation in LA itself. However I seen in here that it's much easier to check the city with a car. Is this true? As normally I always use a public transportation when visiting City's i have never been before.  
* We will book Air bnb accommodations only for the first and last few days in LA. Will there be a possibility just to stop at some small hotels when feeling tired while doing the trip? What about prices? 
* Do we need to google some of the hotels and pre-book the room or we can just stop wherever we want? 
* What are the meal prices in diners on a high way? 
* We are planing to spend a half of a day and a night in Vegas, however we are not interested in Casinos or Partying. Is it worth it?

ESTA - U.S. Point of Contact (but I don't have any),"In order to complete the ESTA application, I need to provide a **U.S. Point of Contact Information**, which can be filled in with ""UNKNOWN"" (but the fields are mandatory).  


However, the FAQ on ESTA's website mentions the following:

&gt;**Can I apply for an ESTA without having confirmed travel plans?**  
Yes. Specific travel plans are not mandatory at the time of application, **but you will need a U.S. point of contact.**  
Although specific travel plans are not required, the address where  you will be staying in the United States is recommended to complete the  application. If multiple locations are planned, you only need to enter  the first address. If a complete address is not known, you can enter the  name of the hotel or location you will visit.  
If you are in transit, please select 'yes' to the 'Is your travel  to the U.S. occurring in transit to another country?' question in the  Travel Information section.

Notice the bold emphasis on the answer? It says I **need** to have a U.S. point of contact. However, I am applying for the ESTA way before I book any hotel reservations, hence, I can't put the name of a hotel. How should I proceed? I mean, I could book a hotel, but if I changed it, wouldn't the U.S. point of contact be immediately outdated? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the ""U.S. point of contact"" field being mandatory and unchangeable?",travel

Need vacation ideas for a budget minded couple,"Hey Everyone!

As the title says, I need vacation ideas for my girlfriend and I's birthdays (30 &amp; 35). We want to travel anytime between 27th of July, to the first week of September, for a max of 4 nights/5 days. It can't be any earlier or later in the year unfortunately. 

Cost: Her total which would include everything is $900 MAX (which I already explained to her for most popular destinations, will probably not cover it given the time frame in which we want to travel). I can go a little higher, but don't want to spend more than maybe $1.1-1.2k which should include everything (travel, food, activities).

Activities: I like outdoorsy activities (ATVs, ziplining, hiking, ect.) but I also love pools/beaches/lounging, I just don't want that to be the bulk of the trip. She loves the beach/pools, but is open to other activities like the ones I mentioned. We both like the idea of theme parks, but I'm not a huge fan of roller coasters or rides in general, whereas she is (We did Universal a couple of years ago, and I had a good time despite not going on many rides).

Things I've researched: Me personally, I would love to take a trip to Puerto Vallarta, but the flights to get there are astronomically expensive for us. I checked out all inclusive vacations, but from what I've read on here, it makes more sense financially to fly there, get an AirBnB (the ones I found look fantastic and they're cheap, but the flights are crazy expensive) and find things to do ourselves, please correct me if I'm wrong on this. I looked into Disney world, Disneyland, and some cruises, but again, it's going way over our altogether budget of $2k. I messaged Magical Vacations to see what deals they can offer me, but I know they're basically only good for hotel/park tickets, I would need to take care of travel arrangements. We considered cruises (which I need to do more research on), but she's a little hesitant about them given the horror stories she's heard, and she's afraid of getting sea sick.

At this point, I'm just looking for some good ideas for a couples vacation, for under $2k (local or international, doesn't matter we both have our passports and I have a drivers license), or maybe major discounts/fixes or tweaks on things I already mentioned. 

Thank you for your time!

I've been working on planning my own graduation trip for a few weeks now and I have a general itinerary down: land in Tangier, stay for a couple nights, Chefchaouen for one night then on to Marrakech for the remaining few nights, including a day trip to Essouira. I was thinking of doing airbnb's in the first two cities, maybe a hotel in Marrakech?

Obviously this all is contingent on the following: my parents really don't want me to go. My dad had some super negative travel experiences when he was my age (in the US and Europe) and thinks I do not appreciate how dangerous it is to travel solo.

I'm a decently experienced traveler, just me and my SO did London and Brussels last summer together, my whole family has gone round Europe together too. All that sounds annoying, I just mean that I'm no stranger to dealing with tourist scams and street hustlers. (I know that even Paris is not necessarily as aggressive as Morocco's medinas would be).

I guess the concern is I haven't really traveled alone before? And they say why not just ask a friend: I don't want a friend. I feel like solo travel is particularly rewarding and I've read Morocco is a particularly exciting place to have that experience, and I feel like I'm ready. Am I wrong? (fyi i am real skinny and have brown hair, i'm half latino (just because blonde hair sticks out i've read))
