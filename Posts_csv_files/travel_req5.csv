Flexibility with tour companies in terms of schedule etc,"Hi, I’m looking to go to USA or Canada in possibly August. I’m too disconcerted to travel alone, so I may go with one of those companies that take you with a group of other people and you do things on a schedule, such as Contiki, Topdeck, STA travel, G Adventures, Intrepid, maybe others. (Open to other ones!)

I’m looking for a mixture of scenery (Pacific NW/Colorado or Canada, maybe a few other places instead) but bars, so cities or towns, as well.

How do those things work in terms of flexibility? Do you have opportunities to go off and do your own thing, or with others? Say if you wanted to stay in a particular place for longer, do you get those opportunities? 

Thanks.",travel

Inexperienced 24 year old looking for recommendations/advice for a budget beach holiday at the end of September,"My girlfriend booked our last holiday, now its my turn. Put simply, she wants a nice beach with lots of sun, and I just want some good food.

Shoes for Mongolia,"Hey guys, so my and I are going on a trip to Mongolia in about 2 weeks time.

"4 Days in Ireland, am I being too ambitious with the itinerary?","My girlfriend and I are planning a trip through the UK in August, with 4 of those days spent in Ireland.

Backpacking bag may be too big for carry-on??,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've borrowed a backpacking backpack from a friend and am quite anxious to know if it'll pass as a carry-on. From what I see online, the bag is 28"" x 12.5"" x 12"", or 14 x 63 x 30 cm. The standard dimensions for these airlines are: 56 x 45 x 25 cm. I've heard mix reviews on budget airlines like easyjet and wizzair around Europe, and am worried that they will require me to pay more money when I arrive at the airport. In my opinion, my bag will not be jam packed and look super full, but I'm just afraid they'll ignore this strictly because the bag is just a tad bit taller.

"4 Days in Norway Reccomendation (Begin Oslo, End: Bergen)","Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for recommendations for two 30-year-old couple for a 4 day trip leaving Oslo on a Friday morning and getting to Bergen in time for a Tuesday early AM flight in late July/Early August. We're both active and are 100% comfortable using public transporation.

&amp;#x200B;

We are trying to decide between booking public transportation solely (such as using the Norway in a Nutshell model), or some combination of public transportation/renting a car either in Voss, Bergen or over in Sogndal.

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, we were thinking Train to Myrdal to Flam + Ferry to Gudvagen to Voss and then rent a car to go down to Odda/Trolltunga area before returning to Bergen. Only problem with this model is a one-way rental cost and hassle of picking up the car.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am now wondering if its worth it to go North from Flam towards Songdal/Geiranger instead, and do a longer Fjord tour/relying more on public transportation.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Looking for advice on travel itinerary to Vietnam,"Hello,

I’m currently planning a trip to Vietnam with my partner (both around 30 in case that helps with suggestions) during the first two weeks of August and am hoping to get some guidance on if the itinerary makes sense and if we should be tweaking it to compress certain places to maximize time in other areas. If you have suggestions on other places we should try to fit in with the time we have then we’re also open to suggestions. I have the flights to Ho Chi Minh already so they’re pretty set in stone, but the rest is fairly flexible.

Right now the plan is the following:

August 5th: Arrive in Ho Chi Minh around 10 am

August 5th: fly to Da Nang, stay in Hoi An for 4 nights (Visit Da Nang and Hue)

August 9th: fly to Hai Phong and head straight to Ha Long Bay, spend 1 night

August 10th: transit to Hanoi, spend 2 nights

August 12th: visit Ninh Binh, spend 2 nights in Tam Coc

August 14th: fly to Ho Chi Minh, spend 3 nights, visit Mekong Delta

August 17th: Flight to Canada around 6 pm

"Mardin, Sanliurfa, Midyat, Hasankeyf TURKEY - My Experiences","Hi folks, I'm a 20 years old native who lives in Adana, Turkey currently. As you know, southeast of Turkey is upper part of Mesopotamia and of course, a centre for early civilizations. Since I'm not from around here actually, that part of Turkey has always been charming for me. So I decided to take a 3-day tour -respectively- Mardin, Midyat, Hasankeyf, Sanliurfa by car.

Apart from showing a basic itinerary to foreign tourists, other reason I write this post is changing your ""impression"" about ""southeast part of Turkey"". Since my childhood, I  always had knew this area as ""troublesome place"" and -to be honest- I was afraid to go such place until my grad from high school (because there was a conflict with a political party who claims defending Kurds rights but gets involved in some terroristic activity.) But nowadays, there is not such problem. According to my impression, except for Hakkari and Şırnak, it's quite safe actually. (I even don't know if there are some kind of touristic place to see there.)

&amp;#x200B;

Before starting, I want to make clear things first.

1- If you don't rent car, I suspect you can go to some far places from city. So, be ready for renting car for 1-day. I'll state those places later.

2- I specified Mardin as main point, tried to go everywhere in Mardin. But Sanliurfa had some exception though.

3- Definitely, don't include Monday in your program since museums are closed through Turkey.

4- Google ""museum pass turkey"" if you have a big visiting. If not so and if you are a student, indicating that you're student (with student id card) will help you to get a student ticket at museums.

5- Most outdoor place in Mardin and Midyat, there will be children who wants to help about simple guiding about history or location, good photo spots etc. You can ask help. They will not want money, but after you've done it is expected to give some money (2-3 TL is ok). And most likely, there will be children who sells bottled water in summer for their school expenses. Please try to get your water from them, it's cheaper than any other place and even you can get an icy one.

6- Learn a few Turkish sentences like ""Can I get a bottle of water- Bir şişe su alabilir miyim?"" or ""Can you take a photo of me- Fotoğrafımı çekebilir misiniz?"". Of course, you can add ""please-lütfen"" at the end of the sentence if you want to be super nice.

**DARA RUINS/ANCIENT CITY- Dara Harabeleri/Antik Kenti**  (car is needed) (30km away from Mardin)

After a long road-trip, I eventually reached to Dara Ruins at 12pm. It's free and you'll find a board that tells the story about Dara (Turkish and English as well). There are some cool places that you may want to take a photo of.

&amp;#x200B;

And you'll see lots of skeletons inside main cave. That carved-rock thing at top of main cave indicates what this cave includes floor by floor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Except for main part, there are 3 more structure (cistern/dungeon) you need to see. One is right behind cafe/restaurant of main place, other two are 300m away. You can ask to one of the child waiting at entrance to get you there. Definitely go.

&amp;#x200B;

After those buildings, I suggest you go to top of village where has a dome-like small building and tombs around that. Here you go.

**Sakıp Sabancı Mardin City Museum - Sakıp Sabancı Mardin Kent Müzesi**

We finally got to Mardin. Actually, on our route from Dara Ruins to Mardin, there is Deyrulzafaran Monastery. I'd say stop by, I had a time problem so I went later there.

I parked the car and climbed stairs from downtown, that was awesome. Don't hesitate wondering and being lost in Mardin streets :) We are at east part of Old Mardin now.

It's not a big museum relatively, you can spend 45 min at max I guess. Entrance fee is 2 TL. It's good for you to know about Mardin. Read all boards. Try taking photos from windows looking Mesopotamia.

&amp;#x200B;

**Zinciriye Madrasah - Zinciriye Medresesi**

For those don't know what medrese, it is Muslim thelogical school like monastery. There is no longer medrese education since Atatürk's Education Reform so it's not active.

You'll climb a bunch of great stairs, absolutely take some photo. While climbing, there is another building on your left, you can take a look. When you finally reached up there, you'll see a closed door which is the old door of medrese, get there and take a few photo.

After that, there is entrance forward ahead. Entrance is free. I don't know how, but in some way, definitely learn the meaning of the fountain and why its name is Zinciriye. And of course, doing some photography at fountain is vital :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you've finished your visiting, get out of medrese and down there you'll see a park spot. Take some photos there, too!

Then, go back to stairs and make your way to **ULU CAMİ - ULU MOSQUE**

&amp;#x200B;

**MARDİN MUSEUM - MARDİN MÜZESİ**

After leaving Ulu Cami - Ulu Mosque, this is your next stop. Try to go there by using streets, not main road, it'll be wonderful.

Entrance is 5 or 6 TL. It's built in an old Mardin house. Upper floors are full of interesting stuff, lower floor is some kind of craftshop/atelier.

**DEYRULZAFARAN MONASTERY - DEYRULZAFARAN MANASTIRI  (5 km away from Mardin)**

Next day, here is first stop. If you're staying in Old Mardin, you can postpone this a little bit.

It's still an active monastery that has living people in it with some students. Entrance fee is 10 TL. Entrances are group by group, every 30 mins. While waiting for that, try Deyrulzafaran Tea at cafe.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll climb a lot again, and up there a guide will be waiting for you, but I don't know whether they tell in English. Ask while buying ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

And bunch of good photos, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

First stop was Midyat Caves - Midyat Mağaraları, not much to see. Entrance fee was 2 TL. Next one is the place on Google Maps called Midyat Eski Tarihi Evleri - Midyat Old Historical Houses. Along that way, you'll experience streets' and houses' soul. Don't be afraid of being lost because that won't make you help to not get lost :) Thanks to Google Maps, right ?

Thereby, we just have finished our Midyat experience. Without any doubt, you can say now Mardin is more preserved in terms of culture and touristic attractions :) Time to meet with Hasankeyf.

&amp;#x200B;

**HASANKEYF**

You may not have heard Hasankeyf yet. Let me tell its story.

Hasankeyf is one of victims of Southeastern Anatolia Project. Since this project is a sustainable development, it has been a key for region and people. Agricultural and employment matters are taking a big role as well. In cause of this, Ilısu Dam will take its place in other 21 dams. And this dam's reservoir includes Hasankeyf too, unfortunately.

It's been known one of the big settlements for old civilizations and in its very own lands, it has so many different buildings such as **Zeynel Bey Türbesi - Zeynel Bey Mausoleum , Castle, Old Bridge, Artuklu Hamamı- Artuquid Bathhouse, El-Rızk Cami-Mosque,** or **caves**

Sadly, you will not be seeing most of this when you arrive there. As far as I noticed, only mausoleum has been relocated at new settlement area. A few more will be relocated that I've heard so far. Old Bridge is still there. Not only I couldn't see Castle's bottom that I like as a whole, but also I've seen a fracking dam structure that destroyed whole castle stuff and its natural caves!

Here is punchline. HASANKEYF IS EXPECTED TO BE SUNK TILL THIS WINTER. Last chance to get on train...

Is it worth it to visit Hawaii for our honeymoon?,"My fiancée and I are getting married next year, and we are already starting to gather ideas of where we would like to go for our honeymoon. We have always been really interested in visiting Hawaii, but I  wanted to know if it's really worth it or if it's not as great as it seems.

We are from Spain so our idea of Hawaii is based on what we have seen of it in movies, tv shows, etc. Mainly we fell in love with Hawaii after watching things like the TV show Lost, Jurassic Park, and pretty much every movie that features the islands, forests, mountains, beaches... But I am aware that it is a very specific side of Hawaii that we have been exposed to and that you can never fully trust what a movie shows about a specific place, so wanted to know if anyone here lives there or has travelled to Hawaii that could give us a more realistic feeling of what to expect.

Really what draws us in is the great presence of nature, the overwhelming size of those green and peaceful islands and friendly, laid-back people... I guess you can get an idea of what we have been sold if you have ever watched Lost, Jurassic Park, 50 First Dates or even Lilo&amp;Stitch... you know what kind of image of Hawaii these movies normally sell.

Now, I am not naive, I am aware that we would not be staying in a private cabin surrounded by the astonishing nature landscapes I have in my mind, or bathing in deserted, cristal clear beaches (and, if that's an option, it would probably be prohibitively expensive).  Most likely we would have to stay in a massive hotel or resort in the city full of tourists and a bit far from the ""real"" Hawaii.

But I want to have a bit more information about what can be done or seen there, if it's really worth it or not... we don't want to go there expecting to be in this otherworldly place on earth just to end up disappointed if in reality it's much more mundane or doesn't have much to offer apart from relaxing beach holidays.",travel
Hotels.com - Pool Closure - refund?,"Hi everyone,

I booked a non refundable room through hotels.com. I’ve been planning this trip for months and was positive that this resort is where I wanted to stay. I’ve been there in person before and loved it so when it was time to book the room we booked non refundable because we were so sure of how great the place was. My in-laws were looking at the website for the hotel today and noticed the the entire pool is closed during our stay. The pool was literally the whole reason we were going to this place. It’s practically a water park. This wasn’t mentioned anywhere on hotels.com and I really feel like this should’ve been very important front and center information given that the pool is why people go to this resort.

Type of Bag/Luggage needed for 2-weeks in Spain,"Hello community! I am going to Spain in May for 2-weeks, which will be my first time overseas (I have been to Costa Rica). I plan on doing Barcelona, Madrid, and several other cities while I am there. The flight does allow a checked bag for free if I want it. I always use a carry-on bag, but could get a bigger size luggage if needed. I will be using AirBnb so my bag/luggage will always have a good place to hang out, and I can do laundry. However, I don't know what it will be like going through the streets/sidewalks to get to these places etc. I have heard you don't want a rolling back for a longer trip as they can be a pain in the butt. I used my rolling bag in Costa Rica and it was fine (carry-on size), and that along with a hefty Swiss Gear bag carried way more than I really needed for 9-days. I rented a car in CR which made carrying it around very easy also. I have been looking at the Kelty 44, Osprey Farpoint 40, and Tortuga Setout 45 as possible bags to use, but they just seem like they don't have a ton of room. It does kind of suck that my shoe is a size 13 which takes up a lot of space. The advantage of the Swiss Army bag/luggage combo is the SA bag would hold a pair of shoes and the bag was great for a day pack (I hear some places don't allow bags like this inside though).

&amp;#x200B;

Something to think about with a bag like mentioned above is future trips. I won't always have a flight with a bag included and will be at the mercy of a carry on. With that in mind, all options need to be geared toward carry-on and personal item.

&amp;#x200B;

That was a mouthful and hopefully it made sense. Long story short: Spain, 2-weeks, multiple cities, AirBnb, I can do laundry. The main debate is does a rolling back suck for a trip like this or is it really not a big deal? Thanks!",travel

This was on a Sunday morning, so I couldn't afford to take their Tuesday offered replacement flight, as I had shift work on Monday. I ended up getting them to refund my ticket and I bought a last-minute ticket from Frontier, which cost me $300, and also inconvenienced my hosts.

&amp;#x200B;

When I complained, they gave me a $50 flight voucher and a ""meal voucher."" Having never seen a meal offered on their flights, I asked how I would go about redeeming the meal voucher; the customer rep said he didn't know. Whatever. Recently I decided to redeem my flight voucher on their website. When I entered the code to apply it to my flight, it showed as $0.76. I thought this had to be a mistake, but the customer rep said that was by design, that I could only pay for the ""flight portion"" of my ticket (ticket was $90). That was the last straw. I told them I would be willing to pay double the cost of their tickets to their competitors because this was fucking abusive. I'm not taking their bullshit, and you shouldn't either.",travel
South American cities with a Euro vibe?,"I am planning a trip in late December/January with my cousins from Brazil.

Advice for picking islands to hop in Greece?,"My wife and I are very interested about doing a short vacation hopping around the Greek Islands. I've done at least 2-3 hours of research and found many different guides, but I'm just totally overwhelmed by all the options. Was hoping to see if any experienced travelers may help me narrow down some destinations in the Greek Islands that would make sense to chain together.

Here are the facts...

1. Looking to do about 8-10 days total, including travel to/from NYC.
2. Trip would be from very end of July to early August (I know that's not the best time to visit but it's the only time we can)
3. We are big foodies, so would want to prioritize great food first, and maybe beaches second.
4. Approximate budget: $450 per day for each of us,  including lodging, food, entertainment, and travel WITHIN Greece

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at some travel agents and waiting to hear back from a few but most of them that I've found want you to commit 12-16 days. Though also happy to NOT use a travel agent, so long as I could nail down an itinerary that made sense for our priorities, schedule, and budget.

My experience with China visa-free transit,"In hindsight, I probably should've done some more research/planning ahead of time, and I recognize I probably got lucky, but wanted to share my experience so others might learn.

I recently took a trip to Mongolia, and getting there included transit through China: LAX - Changsha (CSX) - Beijing (PEK) - Ulaanbaatar (ULN). I read online that the free transit visa for China only applies for those arriving/departing China from the same airport, e.g. if I had done LAX-PEK-ULN, so I thought, whatever I just won't leave the airport either time, my layovers weren't too long anyway.

What I hadn't considered was the CSX-PEK flight would be domestic, to/from domestic terminals, meaning I had to go through customs, change terminals, and go through security again. Oversight on my part, but at CSX, they didn't seem to have a problem with giving me a free transit visa, even though I was against what I thought were the rules, and going through two Chinese airports. A couple of the customs agents talked about it, but in the end I had no trouble going through customs and security (twice). 

On the way back, I had a similar experience; ULN - PEK - Chengdu (CTU) - LAX. Again, no real issues even though I thought the policy was different.

Did I just misunderstand how the free transit visa works in China? Or did I get lucky, twice? What's been your experience with China transit visas?",travel

Mexico travel itineraries,"I’m planning my first travel to Mexico for three weeks starting mid December this year. My initial thoughts is to travel and see major cities starting in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterey and Merida including Yucatán peninsula and returning to Mexico City.

• Week 2: Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido

• Week 3: Yucatán (Mérida,Cancun and Tulum)  

Mexico City on 31 and boom 💥 new year and adios.

Are there any off the beaten road suggestions? Places to stay or must-do experiences? I’m going with a friend, and we are planning on booking mostly Airbnb but are also considering making one of our stays at a resort (not sure which, though - suggestions welcome). 

We are not looking for night club party type environments. We are seeking adventure and want to experience as much as we can in the short time we will be there.

"Travelling to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan during July - looking for people to hang out with!","Hello folks!

Me and my friend are going to travel around Central Asia from the 17th to the 29th of July.

The initial plan was to travel with a kyrgyz friend of mine but due to some personal issues he won't be able to make it so now we're basically without a ""guide"".

The original idea was to go to Bishkek for two nights and then Ala Archa (day trip), and from there to Osh, then through the Fergana Valley to Andijan, from there to Tashkent and then the rest of Uzbekistan (cities I'm interested in are Samarkand, Bukhara &amp; Khiva) but now plans have changed and I believe (not confirmed yet) we may be going from Bishkek to Almaty and then from there to Tashkent. I believe the fastest way from Almaty to Tashkent is by plane so we might do that. We would be staying in Kyrgyzstan from the 17th to the 20th and in Almaty from the 20th to the 21st and then from the 21st to the 29th in Uzbekistan (not yet sure of how many days in each city). Do you guys have any suggestions or trip advice? I would like to visit all four cities in Uzbekistan but if you believe there might be one I could skip or spend less time in please do let me know!

I made this post mostly to find people to hang out with while we're there that speak english since we will be a little lost by ourselves, let's just say it's a big blow not to have our kyrgyz friend with us.

Day 2 - Half day tour to Blue Lagoon

Day 3 - Ferry to Hvar, stay the night (night out drinking)

Day 4 (Sunday) - Blue Cave then onto Brac (Bol Beach) before returning to Split

Day 5 - Hire bicycles and cycle around Marjan Park / Explore Split

Day 6 - Day trip to Krka Waterfalls OR Cetina River (Cliff jumping/Rafting)

Day 7 -  Bus/Ferry to Dubrovnik, explore the city in the evening

Day 8 - Day trip by Ferry to Mljet National Park

Day 9 - Explore, Wall Tour &amp; Night out in Dubrovnik

Day 10 - Morning explore/chill in Dubrovnik before flying home

Date of Entry to Switzerland - 27th Sep'19 (Around early morning)

Date of Exit from Switzerland - 13th Oct'19 (Around late afternoon)

Itinerary: Zurich-Bern(3N Stay)-Zermatt(4N Stay)-Wengen(6N Stay)-Lucerne(3N Stay)-Zurich

This means after arriving in Zurich Airport, wife and I will be straight away heading to Bern, similarly while coming back we will be heading to Zurich airport from Lucerne.

I know it might sound foolish to not stay in Zurich, however, we are not interested in Museums much and I am particularly interested in photographing the alpine landscapes and hiking hence the unusual long stays in both Zermatt and Wengen. We both are more or less fit for beginner to moderate hiking and would love to explore some areas on foot.

Appreciate if anyone could help with few of my concerns below:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this **itinerary crazy** by any standards?

\- I have looked at historic weather data and found the visit duration quite tourist friendly along those regions, since weather is ever changing, **anybody has any tips or insights** which we should be mindful?

\- We will be heavily relying on the public transport, and aware of the fact that Switzerland has unmatched train service, however I am little confused when it comes to travel pass/discount cards. So there are Half fare card, Swiss Travel pass, Jungfrau region travel pass, **any idea which could be the best suited in your opinion** seeing the fact that we will be extensively travelling using cable cars/trains/Funiculars in and around multiple villages and top of mountains/glaciers.

\- In my research I have found few hiking trails specially the 5 Lake trail from Zermatt. **Any beginner to moderate level Hiking in your opinion that is a must around Zermatt and Jungfrau region**? Kindly suggest please.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope, I sounded sane through out this lengthy post and we thank you for your time and any suggestion you might have.

Many thanks in advance.

How can I condense my one week UK trip?,"Here's some context: I was planning on traveling alone, but my mother decided to tag along because she has family in London. Thus, we have to spend time in London. I, on the other hand, do not enjoy big cities and would much rather spend my time in the Scottish highlands in nature, so I planned to spend a couple days in Isle of Skye. Now, my mother is nearing 50 and not the most energetic, so she wanted to walk less and spend more time in each place. With that in mind, how can I condense my itinerary for an UK first-timer, as in, what can I take out? Again, London and Isle of Skye must be kept.

Do you think that Malaysia is underrated in Asia?,"Malaysia is a wonderful country, but yet I feel that it is quite underrated as most traveller only tend to go to its neighbours country such as Singapore and Thailand. Why is it though? 

I mean Malaysia have amazing food and culture.
As our food are like the fusion of multiple cuisine such as Indian, malay, Chinese and so on.

Malaysia also have beautiful beach such as pulau tioman or pulau rendang. 

Communication in Malaysia is definitely not an issue as most Malaysian are able to speak multiple language such as Chinese , English, malay, Cantonese and so on.

What should I do with Agoda?,"I am planning to stay at Seoul for a week, so I booked a Hotel with Agoda for around 500$ for a stay lasting a week.

However, there are no confirmations about the purchase whatsoever, not even a trace of the transaction in Agoda. In my profile, there should be at least a booking being processed to be accepted and everything, but not even that. I don't even have the booking ID (It displayed as 0 when I completed the purchase)
I've contacted the support, but they seem to be avoiding my issue and instead keep talking about the previous bookings that were cancelled (It's my first time using Agoda, so I made a few mistakes while booking earlier).

Flixbus,"Just thought I'd extend the warning to anyone who have thought about booking with Flixbus; Don't.
On the 27th June we we're riding with them from Amsterdam to Copenhagen.
Let's firstly discuss the preventables.
The bus was over an hour late, customer service said they had no intention of apologising for this as ""delays happen all the time"".
Fair enough.
Once the bus finally gets here the bus driver is among the most rude people I'd ever encountered, opens up the luggage on the side that cars drive on while being preoccupied with her cigarette instead of the safety of her passengers.

At this point you think that its stuck an all time low and that it most likely couldn't have been a worse time with this company.

Well when we crash in Germany due to the driver falling asleep it gets worse, which still somehow manages to not be the worst thing about it all but that the drivers decide to call up flixbus head office instead of calling the emergency services so we end up having to call them ourselves.

All while the drivers are too preoccupied with cooking up some story to head office we're busy dealing with the outcome.

Probably couldn't have prevented the crash, but couldve been handled so much better.",travel

"Nice Hotel in Chaing Mai, Tailand?","Hello,

I am traveling to Chaing Mai in January of 2020. We are only staying 6 days so I would prefer to stay at one hotel the entire time. We are going to be visiting an elephant sanctuary one day during our trip. My questions are:

What are your recommendations for a nice hotel?

I would prefer one that offers massages and has a nice pool with a view.

Is renting a bike a safe way to get around?

Do I have to tell the street food vendors not to make it too spicy, or is that a rumor?

Should I change cash into THB, or just use my credit card?

If I should get THB, when should I change currency?

Any other advice would me much appreciated.

Two weeks in Spain itinerary; staying overnight in Toledo or Segovia?,"Early 30s married couple, love eating, doing some touristy stuff and getting outdoors. This will be our second trip to Spain, first time spent 4 nights in Madrid, day stop in Cordoba, 2 nights Seville, 1 Ronda, 2 Granada, 2 Valencia, 4 Barcelona. This time we will have 13 nights in August, flying in/out of Madrid, tentatively thinking 1 night Madrid area, 3 Granada, 3 Seville, 3 Cadiz, 3 Madrid. Also interested in Jerez de la Frontera, Toledo, and Segovia.

I am considering the 1 night in the beginning due to awkward arrival time and trains to Granada, and I do not want to drive. Should we stay overnight in Toledo or Segovia that night, if so which one, or is it better to just go as day trips from Madrid later on? I'd like to see both either way, but not sure if it's worth staying overnight.

Any recommendations about the order of cities, or for things to do, places to visit would be greatly appreciated!

Having said that, we are def looking to do at least 2 beach days. The problem is, I don’t know what would be my best choice with travel and logistics. I would like to have a morning of beginner surfing, but if it makes sense, then I’d cut that out as well.

The beach recommendations that we are considering are: Ericeira, Miramar, and comporta. 

I don’t mind having a day of crowded beach (if it’s worth it) but I would def like to have one day at a beautiful but less crowded beach (somewhere that we can have a spiritual experience, if you will).

The other places we’re looking to check out are Sintra and Nazare.

Unemployed student - tips for getting US tourist visa?,"Hello!

I want to plan a one week trip with my girlfriend to the US. I already have a date in mind that would work perfectly for us and we found some killer deals on plane tickets and a hotel. We haven’t purchased anything yet, as we’re a bit afraid of getting our visa rejected. At the moment, we are both unemployed students and next year we will be in our final year of our Bachelor. By the time we would travel, we would actually have a job as teacher assistants at our school, which would mostly fund our trip (along with savings from what our parents send us), but getting the visa then would not be the best choice, as the plane ticket and hotel prices would skyrocket. However, we’re worried that we will get our visa rejected because we don’t have any income right now. (It may also be relevant that our country’s tourist visa rejection rate is around 10%)

Would it be enough to tell them that we’re in our final year in college, right before starting our graduation project? It would be pretty obvious to me that a couple of students would have no reason to stay illegally in the US, considering the trip would be just before their big graduation project, but I have no idea how the people at the embassy see this. Also, what would we upload to the income section in the DS-160 form, just say no income ($0) and move on?

Looking for advice on travelling to and around Australia from the UK in January to March 2020.,"My gf and I are going to travel to Australia in January 2020. The length of time we go for will completely depend on how much money we can save but we would like to go for around 10 weeks. The places we would like to visit are Brisbane (&amp;Noosa), Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide &amp; Perth although these aren't concrete and we will visit where ever is beautiful and within our budget and time frame. We are planning on staying in hostels 4 or 5 nights per week and then in an airbnb or hotel 2 or 3 nights per week. We basically want the best accommodation for as cheap as possible. (Isn't that what everybody wants haha!) The main thing we need advice on is budgeting and what the cheapest routes to and around Australia are as well as cost saving whilst we are there. I'll leave a few questions below but any advice you have at all for a couple travelling around Australia at this time of year is very much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the cheapest route to and from Australia from the UK in January?
2. What route would you recommend as the cheapest around Australia and via what forms of transport? - We would like to drive from Brisbane to Sydney.
3. What are some good ways to pack everything you need for 10 weeks in a 65L backpack? -What do you deem a necessity and what can be left behind?
4. I have eczema - Does anyone have experience treating eczema on long trips abroad in completely different climates. I'm worried about where I can buy creams and if they will be suitable as to take 10 weeks of cream there with me would be too heavy.
5. What is the best way to go about renting a car to drive from Brisbane to Sydney? My gf has had a full UK driving license for around 2 years and will be aged 23 at the time.
6. Are there any incredible Airbnbs or hostels that you would recommend that are cheap for what you get?
7. We are thinking of potentially stopping over in Singapore on the way there and Malaysia on the way back. Is there a cheap way to do this and is it worth it or should we spend all of our time in Australia?
8. Is it worth at any point to check out New Zealand whilst we are in that area of the globe? Is it feasible to do this on a budget?
9. Are there any large events or national holidays that aren't to be missed in January to March 2020?

"Having trouble adjusting after travel, any tips?","I am currently taking a month long vacation to visit family in Bosnia and Croatia. It has been a while since traveling and ever since the plane ride I’ve had consistent headaches everyday. 

I know that a big part of that is sleep, since I arrived I’ve napped every day during the day since I haven’t adjusted and then at night I don’t sleep much. 

Also, since landing I haven’t had appetite either. I haven’t really ate one big full meal since I got here, it’s been 4 days. 

Normally I am fine at adjusting but there are a few downsides to my vacationing so far. It’s extremely hot here in Croatia and the apartment and home I’m staying in don’t really have AC at all.

Question about missed flights and lost luggage.,"If there is a better sub for this let me know. Thanks!


The original route I was supposed to take:


Point A to Point B on Airline 1.

Point B to Point C on Airline 1.

Point C to Point D on Airline 2.


Due to a delay and a missed flight at Point B, the real route ended up being:


Point A to Point B on Airline 1

Point B to Point X on Airline 1

Point X to Point Z on Airline 3.


My checked luggage never made it to my final destination, obviously with so many different airlines and cities involved. I’ve filed a lost luggage report with Airline 3 and no updates. Last I heard was that it is at Point B and may be headed to Point C, but I just called to ask and now they’re saying it might go to Point Q. Is my luggage lost forever? Has anyone gone through this and know if I can be compensated for the items in my luggage without receipts? It was basically 40 lbs of clothing I’ve acquired over the years but would be quite expensive if I had to purchase them all again. Thanks for any insight you may have.",travel

Need some help planning New Zealand trip,"I'll be visiting New Zealand at the end of November for about 9 days with my partner. We'll be flying into Auckland late Saturday afternoon (this is primarily because I could get there on air miles much easier). I'm only probably planning on spending Saturday in Auckland and flying out early Sunday. However, I may stay till Sunday night if there's something nearby cool. Thinking some sort of hike as I'm a pretty avid hiker.

After this we'll be flying to the South Island. Thinking of doing something like flying to Queenstown and flying back out of Christchurch (or vice versa). This will give us 7-8 days with the last day having to leave probably by around 8-9 PM from the airport to catch our flight in Auckland at 11:55 PM.

So I'll admit I haven't done an extensive amount of research yet cause I'm a bit overwhelmed with options. I'm not sure what is reasonable to cover in this time and where we should prioritize spending the most time. As I said before we are pretty avid hikers and I was planning on doing a 3 day/2 night trip somewhere when we are out here. So recommendations for that would be awesome. Mountain terrain, waterfalls, and all that jazz. We can probably cover about 15-20km a day so would be looking for around a 40-60km track.

Other than that open to any other suggestions of cool scenic things to check out and do (including non-hiking options), where to stay, and if we should just stick to one side of the island or not. We're pretty into outdoors/adventurous type stuff. I've heard a lot about hot springs so might check those out one day. Not really sure what else yet. I know this is sort of vague, but I'll definitely be doing more research, just hoping people on here can point me in the right direction!",travel

"First solo trip - 2 weeks in Europe, where should I go?","So, I've never traveled alone and have decided the time is finally nigh for a bit of reflective exploration. I've narrowed my travel plans to somewhere in Europe, but beyond that, I haven't decided on much else.

Swiss and Italian alps - 10 days itinerary,"I am travelling with my girlfriend through the alpine region of Italy and Switzerland for 10 days in August. I've never been to these places and would love to hear the opinions of those that have already been!

Day 2 - We have a hotel in Albinen for the second night, which we'll be driving to from Chamonix and likely checking out Verbier and/or Zermatt, maybe doing some hiking (I need to do more research on this part)

Day 3 - Wake up early, see Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, do either the First Cliff Walk in Grindelwald or Birg Thrill Walk (I'm leaning towards Birg) and then stay in the Interlaken area for the night.

Day 4 - Check out Harder Kulm and Gelmer Funicular before driving and spending the night in Liechtenstein (about 2.5-3 hr drive from Interlaken).

Day 5 &amp; 6 - Wake up early and begin 3.5 hours to Dolomites, where we will stay for 2 nights. We've yet to book a place yet, eyeing Val Gardena based on others' suggestions but we'll see. We'll likely do some hiking and rent a paddle boat in Lago Di Braies during our time there.

Day 7, 8, 9 - After finishing with Dolomites, we are planning to drive to Venice, leave the car in a garage, spend 3 nights in Venice, with 1 day seeing the fishing island of Burano.

Should I split up with my friend and only meet up for breakfast or dinner?,"I'll try to make this as clear as possible.

I'm currently in Japan, about two weeks into our trip and two more weeks left.

My friend is extremely bad at waking up early, I'm talking about waking up at 12-1 in the afternoon bad.

Before the trip I've asked several times if he's willing to try out all kinds of different cuisines, and I got somewhat of a confirmation from him. But now he refuses to try things like sushi and okonomiyaki and sushi because he doesn't like the texture and such. This applies to attraction and visiting other places too, sometimes he just doesn't show much interest even if he agreed to go.

He is a nice friend, but not a good travel companion, and there are alot of small things that irratates me. I assume I may have things that irratates him too.

I'm now thinking that we split up mostly during the day, and maybe meet up for breakfast or dinner. This way I can enjoy the trip the way I prefer and his the way he wants.

"My Experience with a ""Rushed"" Trip Itinerary, the Good and the Bad","Last summer a group of friends and I—all college-age—took a 10-day trip from LA. to Europe). It was my first time on a non-family trip, as well as my first time overseas or flying alone. Our planned itinerary: 2 days each in Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Vienna, and Budapest. 5 countries in 10 days (it turned out to be 6, we ended up on a spur-of-the-moment bus to Bratislava) is exactly the sort of rushed itinerary I see newcomers post on this subreddit somewhat frequently, so as someone who had actually done it before subscribing here, I thought I'd share my experience.

Did I have fun? Yes, it was a blast! Was it perfect? No, no, nope, definitely not. Here’s a list of things I thought we did right, and also a list of many things we definitely did wrong.

Things we did right:

1. Stayed on top of flight fares and policies. We started keeping an eye on ticket prices 9 months before the trip, and were prepared to buy tickets as soon as we found fares below an agreed-upon threshold; my round trip flight to Paris ended up under $300 (on WOW, but for a student on a budget I can’t complain). We did the research on things like buying tickets on a travel card for the insurance or getting around ATM withdrawal fees (I opened a Charles Schwab account), which ended up helping a lot as well when things went wrong.

2. Kept it relaxed, and accepted before starting the trip that we’re not going to be able to see or do everything, or even close to it. There wasn’t any consternation about missing out on something or wasting time, because we didn’t have many expectations of what we’d be disappointed about missing—and the things we would be disappointed about missing, we prioritized first.

3. Stayed flexible about new or unplanned experiences. Most of our best excursions on the trip were unplanned; we ended up on a day trip to Bratislava, for instance, which was a surprise destination that I very much enjoyed. Other times we went based off the recommendations of other travelers at the bus stop or locals we met along the way, and those activities were a blast, too.

Things we did wrong:

1. Not plan in any rest time. My flight to Paris was delayed, and I ended up meeting up with the rest of my group at around 7 PM in the city. At this point I had been awake for around 30 hours between the trip to LA, the wait at the airport, and me not being able to sleep in vehicles, but I was determined to make up for lost time by compressing the Day 1 itinerary (the sightseeing parts of it) into the next 3 hours. We were staying at a friend’s place, and between jet lag and excitement I wasn’t able to sleep that night, either.  The next day, we stayed out late and didn’t get back home until 3 AM, a few hours before the flight to Amsterdam. Anyways, I managed to sleep for about an hour at the airport itself before boarding, but again couldn’t sleep on the flight. Fast forward another few hours and I unwittingly knocked out on a park bench in Vondelpark, after almost 4 days of no sleep. My friends let me nap for another hour, but I kept falling asleep that day (the highlight is probably me at the Foodhallen passing out on an empty plate turned upside-down as a “pillow”). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Exhaustion hit again in Prague; we had a two late nights out in Vienna and didn’t sleep before our train to Prague. We arrived at the AirBnB and knock out at 8 PM, and we woke up the next day at 6 PM. We more or less wasted a whole day in Prague just catching up on sleep—the rest of our time in the city was great and my friends didn’t mind at all, but I thought it was pretty bad.

2. Trying too hard to do things as a group/not sufficiently planning around individual limitations. One member of our four-person group was vehemently against spending money on tours, museum tickets, activities, etc. It wasn’t a budget restriction, he didn’t like doing those sorts of things, and got a lot of enjoyment out of finding things that were cheap or discounted. It worked out great for our flight fares, but was a hassle when we wanted to see the Anne Frank museum or the Louvre, for instance (we ended up doing neither). Another member of our group was on a budget, which was understandable. In our planned finances I said the trip might be up to $1500 including airfare per person, which I thought was reasonable for a 10 day trip in western/central Europe, especially staying in mostly hostels. He agreed and bought the tickets, but when we actually were on the trip we found out that he didn’t have that nearly that sort of money allocated for the trip, which also affected what we could and couldn’t do since for some reason we all had the notion we had to do everything together. By the time we got to Vienna, me and the other friend finally suggested splitting up if we wanted to do something the other two didn’t, and I think all of us benefited from that decision. We still did most things as a group, but everyone being able to do what they wanted to do was such a simple change that didn’t even cross our minds before this.

3. Related to the above, we kept “running out of things to do,” which sounds terrible but felt true at the time. For instance, we spent our second day in Amsterdam (probably my low point of the trip) doing next to nothing because I simply could not find anything through Google, word of mouth, or otherwise that the group wanted to do. We went to the Foodhallen a second time; I took the aforementioned extended nap; we walked around for about 6 hours without actually entering any stores or doing any activities; we ate dinner; we then walked around another few hours, again without actually stopping anywhere, before calling it a night. In total we visited just 1 place (the Foodhallen), had two meals, and otherwise just walked around the city for the other 10 hours because we had either done everything on my list or considered it unviable (anything that cost money was automatically out of the picture, and by the time we thought about leaving the city it was too late to actually do anything in our destination before having to head back to the hostel). The reasons were a combination of all of the above: poor planning, travel companion restrictions, and shortness on time.

______

So if you have some 2-days-a-country itinerary lined up, I would give the following takeaways.

1. Is it doable? Yes. Is it enjoyable? I had fun on my trip, but at the same time I essentially wasted two days of it by being exhausted. If I were to do a rapidfire trip again, I would try to spend at least 3 days in a city, just to slow down the pace and give myself time to recuperate. People here suggest sticking to one or two places for a weeklong trip for a reason, but it's understandable to want to see a lot of different places without necessarily wanting to get deep into the culture and atmosphere. Still, at least 3 days is what I'd recommend to avoid severe burnout.

2. Consider sticking to a small-ish geographic region. I can't say I particularly enjoyed waking up early after next to no sleep multiple days in the row to catch the planes to Amsterdam and Prague. On the other hand, I think part of the reason I enjoyed Bratislava so much is the lack of rush associated with it; it wasn't on the itinerary in the first place so there was nothing that needed to be done, and the train back to Vienna was short and hassle-free.

3. This one seems obvious in hindsight, but if it's your first trip it might be taken for granted. Make sure you know your travel partners and their preferences. I learned the hard way that some people have very, very different tastes when it comes to travel.

Overall, I enjoyed the trip and considered it a learning experience, and I think I'll look back on it fondly and remember the moment I arrived in Amsterdam and thought, ""yeah, I can spend a full day here even though I haven't slept since I left L.A.!"" I'm going to the UK for another 2-week trip this month and have definitely learned from it myself. Best of luck to anyone else planning their first multi-city trip!",travel

Traveling Europe in January and need some suggestions/tips,"So this January, my brother and I plan to travel to Europe the day after Christmas and stay for about 2-3 weeks.

What place is the best to celebrate New Years? What places do you suggest seeing while at said cities (Good restaurants, must see monuments, etc.)? 

&amp;#x200B;

My next set of questions goes for getting to different countries. What mode of transportation do you think would be best going between cities? What are some good websites or transportation companies that offer pretty cheap flights/train tickets? 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, how much would you say this whole trip is going to cost? I'm a college kid so funds are not that large so any tips on how much cash to bring for the trip or any other types of budgeting tips. Also would love any tips for packing for the weather in Europe during January. I appreciate any advice or suggestions given.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I plan on coming back to Europe next summer for 1-2 months so I will be able to thoroughly visit more places.

Waiting over three weeks for a Schengen visa,"My wife had an interview for a Schengen visa with BLS for a trip to Spain this summer. The interview took place on June 5th. They said that it takes 10 days to process, although on the website it says at least 15 working days. As of now, it's been 17 working days. Their phone number doesn't work, so I can't contact them. Based on what I read, many people receive their visa in just a few days. She is a citizen of the Philippines.

Camping and cycling in Switzerland,"Hello fellow travelers!

I'm traveling to Switzerland with my boyfriend (Geneva) in July, and we're going to stay in the country for six days. I am hoping you can share your experiences if you've been there and hopefully some tips on what to see and do.

We're arriving in Geneva early in the morning, we've never been there before so we're very very excited!- what are your favorite spots there? any must-see places? we LOVE food, so you have a favorite restaurant or bar there please also let us know! Also, do most shops and restaurants take cards or we should take some cash with us?

Although we do want to spend some time (a few hours) in beautiful Geneva, since we're both really into cycling we'd like to rent some bikes and go out of town to explore the countryside. Are there any bike rental shops you'd recommend? The main reason why we've chosen to go to Switzerland is that we love spending time out in the nature so we're mostly interested in mountains, natural parks, lakes and so on. We really like camping, so we're actually taking all our equipment with us and we hope we can just camp instead of having to spend money on accommodation (our budget is quite tight and prices are rather high). Any tips on camping in Switzerland? 

My next question is about the itinerary we should follow. Since we're arriving in and departing from Geneva, it is a must that our itinerary starts and ends in the city. I did find some national cycling routes online, but it is quite difficult to pick one... If any of you has cycled around the country, which route did you follow? which towns, parks or lakes would you recommend visiting? We're both in good physical condition and cycle regularly during spring and summer, so an intermediate level route would be ideal for us.

My last question is about public transportation - We'd like to cycle as much as possible, but we were wondering if there is any public transport that allows you to take your bike with you.

Looking forward to read your replies!

Thank you :) :)",travel
Is it illegal to fly with a Passport in my maiden name?,"Looking to travel internationally, but I'm wondering if I'm breaking the law by flying (and booking) with my maiden name. I recently got married and  just missed the one year cut off for a free renewal. So as of right now, my passport under my maiden name is good for another 9 years! I don't want to have to pay $110 again and go through the whole processing period when I just did all of that over a year ago. 

If I book the itinerary under my maiden name, and travel with a passport that's still in my maiden name, will I get in trouble? Is there a possibility of me getting detained?",travel
Flying with Air Transat from Canada to London- what ammeneties do you get with Economy Class?,"Today in 6 hours I will be flying from YYC to LGW. I have booked an economy class seat. It’s going to be a long flight but at a pretty convenient time as it’s around dinner and I should be able to eat before then. However when I wake 7+ hours into the flight, I will probably be ravenous.

I would like to know before I get to the airport, from anyone who has travelled with this airline before- how does food work? I saw an option to add this “feature” for extra $ when I was booking it but chose not to at the time.

If you don’t book for food, will they still feed you? Can you still order from the menu and pay for food/drink? 

Additionally, I’m flying on an A330-200. Do they come with built in TVs or offer ipads? Does it cost money to watch movies with them?

I did try looking this up but not everything is clear on whether or not these features may be “optional” or come with the flight. I would love to just be certain on this before getting on the plane.


Last of all, if you have a carry on bag, do they check/measure the size? It just has to fit in the overhead cabin or underneath your seat right? What if it’s too fat to fit in the overhead cabin? Can you take some stuff out and shove it in the seat pocket to make it fit?",travel
North France Trip (Normandy),"Hello everyone... I am looking at a holiday in the North of France and I am in dire need of advice on everything from transport to places to stop, to eat etc etc!!

  
I would like to take my parents (in their late 60s) who are in the UK for around a week (perhaps stopping in 2 places), getting an equal balance between sightseeing (castles, churches etc), relaxing on the beaches and some casual drinks in the evening. 

One concern is transport. I would likely look at taking a ferry over from the UK with them- and then I am hoping there are practical trains between the chosen spots? Or is it more likely that a rental car may be best, although they wouldn't handle the stress very well!

New hiking backpack.,"Long story short, I went to Iceland for hiking and did not own a proper backpack.

Travel Video Equipment,"Hello all, just trying to get a check on what people use for video equipment when they travel. I have a bit of a dilemma in which I am conflicted about. Basically I am looking to do some travel vlogging via my smartphone (iPhone 7 Plus) or my GoPro. While the GoPro shoots much higher quality video and is much more robust, it is an additional piece of equipment that takes up valuable space in my day pack and I find myself juggling multiple devices at times just to “capture a moment”. While both are excellent tools, I find myself having too much photography equipment to carry around when I factor in my drone as well as my pocket 360 camera.

Looking to see how others (particularly travel vloggers) deal with this issue.

Tanzania travel vaccination advice,"Not sure if this is the correct place to post so please let me know if not and I can remove it.

I am going to Tanzania in about a month. I will be in Tanzania for 2 weeks Arriving at Dar Es Salaam, Arusha (with 2 days safari to  Ngorongoro Crater  and Lake Manyara), Moshi (5 day Kili climb) and Zanzibar for a few days.

I live in Japan and travel vaccinations are not included on the health insurance here so they are pretty expensive. I had most my vaccinations many years ago in the UK. In Japan I managed to get the Yellow Fever Vaccine a few months ago in Japan (was an absolute mission but technically got it free as it's in a trial stage here) and I just paid out approx $300 for Hep A booster, Typhoid and 50 Doxcy tablets. This at least pretty much clears me for the main required vaccinations.

However, the vaccination for Cholera (is somewhat recommend but optional from my research) will cost me approx $170 here in Japan.

My question is, has anyone ever gone to Tanzania (and the places I am going to) without this vaccination? Is it required? Would safe precautions with food/drink + water purification tablets help? 

I don't really want to pay out that much for it as this trip is already quite a lot.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Saving Jars of Dirt,"I saw Saving Private Ryan on opening weekend in July of ’98.  The epic war drama is, almost twenty-one years later, still one of my favorite films... though I’ve only seen it a couple of times.  If you’ve seen it, you know it can be hard to watch.  I clearly remember the entire audience openly sobbing after the beach scene.  The film’s realism can be almost unbearable at times, and its expert character development really makes you feel for the soldiers... to understand them as if they were real people that you know... to hurt when they hurt, laugh when they laugh, and to weep for their families when they’re gone.  Of course, I’d expect nothing less from Spielberg.

&amp;#x200B;

When I watch a movie like that, or read a really engrossing book, I imagine which character I most identify with... or which is most like myself.  In Saving Private Ryan, Tech Sergeant Mike Horvath is me.  He’s not the hero, he’s not the sexy one, and he’s not the cool one.  Sergeant Horvath is the guy who says what he thinks, and stands up for what he believes is right... no matter what.  He’s Captain Miller’s only real friend, and Captain Miller is his.

&amp;#x200B;

Without just coming right out and saying, “Hi, I’m so-and-so from wherever”, Spielberg carefully peppers Saving Private Ryan‘s characters with little back stories in the form of conversations and poignant visuals.  In particular, one of these very brief shots has stayed with me all these years.  Upon securing the beach at Normandy, Sergeant Horvath is seen filling a small can with dirt.  Putting the lid on the can, we see it’s labelled “France”.  He then places the can into his backpack with other cans labelled “Africa” and “Italy”.

&amp;#x200B;

Much like travelers of bygone years would affix stickers to their steamer trunks, these were Sergeant Horvath’s souvenirs.

&amp;#x200B;

In the midst of war, he couldn’t very well stroll through the giftshops of Paris or the markets of Tunisia for souvenirs to take home to his family.  What he did instead was collect a little bit of the place, itself.  The dirt in those cans were a tangible part of where he’d been... mementos of places and experiences more meaningful than any t-shirt or snow-globe could ever be.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know why, but that really stuck with me.  I love the thought of it... of bringing home a piece of the place, and not just some kitsch trinket that probably wasn’t even made there.  This isn’t a reminder that I once visited France.  This is France.  And so, I started doing it, myself.  Whenever I travel to a new place, I try to collect a little piece of it.  I’ve got sand from various beaches and dirt from various cities and parks and water from rivers and lakes.  I haven’t been successful in getting these little “samples” from every place I’ve been, but definitely a lot of them.  And I haven’t been even remotely successful in collecting them all in the same kind of container, either... they’re a bit of a mish-mash of what I had available at the time, but I love them.  They’re a unique sort of souvenir, and it’s fascinating to see the differences in the colors and textures.  Right now, all my little jars are piled up on the fireplace mantle, but I hope to someday build a proper display for them.

[Discussion] Your Airport Habits,"I have nothing going on this Thursday afternoon so I just wanted to spark some discussion with anybody who is willing to engage!

- What are your airport habits when travelling

- How early do you arrive for check in? 

- Have you ever cut your check-in a little *too* close?

- Do you have routines before/after going through security? 

- Do you prefer direct flights or layovers?

- If you have a layover, do you like a short or long layover?

- What types of things do you do to pass the time during a layover?

- Other airport habits or routines?

Sometimes I'm a pretty rushed person, but for travelling I usually take a sort of ""hurry up and wait"" approach. The main airport I fly out of is about a three hour drive from where I live, so if I'm driving there the same day I like to leave about six hours before my flight and am not opposed to leaving even earlier if theres a chance of running into traffic during rush hour or the possibility of inclement weather.

My airport is pretty easy to check into, but I always check in at least 2 hours prior to my flight. I even do this at super small airports where most people say you can check in 30 mins to an hour before your flight time. 

After I check in I like to find a place to sit outside of security where I do quick self bag check to make sure I didnt absent mindedly pack prohibited carry on items, stow my keys, remove my belt if wearing one, and ready my boarding pass(es) and ID so I can move through security as quickly as possible. First thing I do after going through is to find a water fountain to fill my bottle at, locate my gate, give my phone a final charge and just enjoy the airport atmosphere somewhere nearby my gate. 

I actually want and hope for a layover. The longer the better. Up until about... 10 or 12 hours. An 8 hour layover is great! The same intial routine goes on after I enter the new airport: fill water, locate gate. Once I've found my gate and confirm that it still has the correct destination listed, I go on an airport exploration. Airports are the very best for people watching so I'll do plenty of that, I'll walk around and look at the different displays of art or signs which that city's airport likes to display, scout which airport food I want to eat, and maybe grab a drink. For whatever reason I love to just waste a day in the airport and long layovers ensure I dont have to ever feel rushed.

Anyway, that was probably all way more information than anybody cares about, but feel free to describe your traveling habits and thoughts!",travel

Revised Europe Itinerary,"I'm back with a *little* bit of a better idea of what is going on. My plan in my previous plan was too ambitious, so I cut Croatia and the French Riviera. Please take a look at my revised itinerary and offer any suggestions (if you feel like it).

The only things that are set in stone are the following:

I get into London on July 6th then fly to Paris (was cheaper than Eurostar) on July 10th. From Paris, I fly to Milan on July 16th. I am in Italy from July 16th- August 9th. On August 9th, I fly from Naples to London and only have one day there before its back to the US.

I am planning on getting around Italy primarily via train. Here's a rough sketch of what I would like to do:

* Milan (16-17)
* Lake Garda (17-18): Sirmione or Malcesine ??
* Verona (18-19)
* **Venice** (19-22)
* **Florence** (22-25)
* Lucca (25-27): Day trip Pisa
* **Rome** (27-3)
* **Amalfi Coast (3-8**): Sorrento, Capri, Positano, Salerno??
* Naples (8-9)

The bolded places (Venice, Florence, Rome, Amalfi Coast) are my ""musts."" My budget is around $4200 USD now. This is my first time in Italy (and Europe), so I don't know what I am doing and I'm very open to making changes to my plan in Italy. The only bookings in Italy are my flight into Milan and my flight out of Naples. Is this plan over-doing it? Should I stay in Verona for two nights and make Lake Garda a day trip?

Can you help me think of a vacation idea for next week?,"I have a 4 day weekend next week and this year I resolved to be more outgoing, with one of the primary focuses being vacations. I’m 30 and have only ever gone on one vacation that I had any hand in planning (I’ve been plenty of places but with family only). 

I want to do something for these 4 days; maybe drive somewhere or even buy round trip tickets (is that feasible a week before July 4? Or is it too expensive?). I live in SLC and I think I have enough money to afford whatever reasonable thing I can do alone (I will be alone). I am not comfortable doing something totally outdoorsy alone, not because I’m not into that but mostly because I’m too inexperienced. Any good ideas? I would like to visit a random city and just see what it’s about. For example, I love Vegas but have been there many times. I love roller coasters, and just exploring a city.

London/Amsterdam/Paris itinerary,"My wife and I will be spending 12 days in Europe in September. Below is how we are planning to split the days so far: 

Day 1: Arrive early morning in London

Day 2: London

Day 3: London 

Day 4: London 

Day 5: London 

Day 6: Early train to Amsterdam

Day 7: Amsterdam

Day 8: Amsterdam, late train to Paris?

Day 9: Early train to Paris?

Day 10: Paris

Day 11: Paris

Day 12: Paris

The London part of the trip we're pretty set on, we're kind of torn on the Amsterdam/Paris part, specifically Day 8 and Day 9. Would it be better to spend the night on Day 8 in Amsterdam and head to Paris early morning Day 9? Or head to Paris late Day 8 so we have 4 full days in Paris? 

Things we want to see in Amsterdam: Anne Frank house, Vondelpark, Jordaan, Red Light District, canal tour, A'DAM Lookout, Van Gogh museum, Zaanse Schans.

Things we want to see in Paris: Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Champs-Elysees, Pont Neuf, Versailles, Dôme des Invalides, Sainte-Chapelle, Montmartre, Paris Catacombs.

Any advice? Based on our plans so far, I'm kind of leaning towards heading to Paris early morning on Day 9.

Seriously why is LAX such a pathetic dump of an airport??,"I have travelled through many of the “worst airports” on earth - JFK, Heathrow, CDG, etc. Yeah they aren’t great, but at least theres an “attempt” to not blatently give every traveller through it the finger. There’s actual things like Trains connecting the terminals and city, some attempts to look aesthetically pleasing, and some degree of functionality. I actually don’t hate them, much as I don’t rave about them. 

But LAX - just.... holy fuck. They literally don’t even try. I guess if you start or end there it wouldn’t be outrageously bad, but connecting through it is a goddamn nightmare. You literally have no choice but to walk across the airport campus and the insane traffic lugging your shit in the SoCal heat if you have to change terminals, public transit is non existant, the terminals themselves are DUMPS and the staff just has 0 fucks to give. And the signage is terrible.

US Passport Renewal (minor)- Apply in person at an agency or send through mail,"So I have to renew my daughter’s passport which expired in May. Unfortunately, because my ex-husband hasn’t sent me the “Statement of Consent for Issuing a Passport to a Child” yet, we haven’t been able to renew it. We have an overseas trip booked and paid for, leaving August 2nd.

He “says” it should be here by 7/2, he lives overseas and we live in the US....I won’t even get into how long I’ve been asking for this paperwork.  If for some miracle it does get here on the 2nd my daughter and I can go to the post office (after making an appointment for passport service) on the 3rd. If I pay for the expedited service it “should” take 2-3 weeks for us to receive it.  Our trip is on the 2nd of August so basically 4 weeks from when we renew and our trip.

Would you guys chance that? Or should we just wait until 2 weeks of travel and just make an appointment with a passport agency. We’re lucky to live near the PA one and the NYC one.  At this point money isn’t a factor because it would be the same amount if I were to apply in person or mail it out....

Good Luggage Brand?,"So I know I'm definitely overthinking everything. I'm going on my first flight ever from DTW to CDG with Air France both ways. I made sure to book a direct flight because I'm terrified of my luggage getting lost and missing connections etc.

I'll be staying for 147 days so I need a checked bag and a carry-on. I've been struggling to settle on a set of luggage for like two months now.

Do I go with hard-side or soft? I'm worried about the case cracking and I just don't know what to buy.

I've read that most airlines don't actually measure the sizes of your bags unless they are super oversized, but I'm still paranoid.
