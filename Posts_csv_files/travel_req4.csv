8 Days in Turkey,"** apologies if this ends being a repeat; I can't see my post from my first attempt ** 

Hello all, 

My wife and I are planning to travel to Turkey next month for 8 days. There are only the places on our travel plan - Istanbul and Cappadocia. Both of us really want to do the hot air balloon flight since we don't know if we'll get the chance to go to Turkey again. 

I was hoping for some advice from this vast group of people... 

My initial plan is this... 

4 days in Istanbul. 
5th day transit to Cappadocia. 
3 days in Göreme. 

I was hoping for some advice on... 

1. How many days are ""enough"" for Istanbul? 
2. What are the must do things our of the city around Istanbul? While we have 4 days in the city, we are very open to a day trip to an interesting place or two. I have already been looking at things to do in the city, so I think that's sorted. If there's any advice about things to do in Istanbul city, that's welcome as well. 
3. While we are considering a flight from Istanbul to Göreme (Kayseri send like the nearest airport), is a bus journey with the time? 
 
Please advise. 

Thanks.",travel

One week in Croatia advice/suggestions,"Hey all

So I'm planning on going to Croata for one week from 22nd July to 29th July. Although I originally planned to start my trip from Zagreb, I found a more convinient and cheaper back and forth flight to and from Split, which would arrive around 11 am on 22nd, and would be departing from Split 11 am local time on the 29th. Thus I won't be visiting the capital, and that has messed up my plans a bit. 

So far I'm certain on 2 days in Split and 2 days in Dubrovnik. That would leave me with 3 additional days, but I'm unsure how to fill that time. 

1) Could I visit Hvar, Korcula and Krka waterfalls within 3 days?

2) Or perhaps extra days in Split, and do some daytrips from there (Plitvice, Trogir, island tours?)

3) Or perhaps something else altogether?

I (25M) will be traveling with my mother (60), so I would like to find a ""best of both worlds"" compromise. Although I might check out local nightlife, she definitely won't do that, so perhaps some more relaxing ideas are welcome. 

Intrests: historical sites, architecture, nature, beaches/sunbathing, good food/wine/local specialities, (anything else not too extreme).

Another question I have concerns getting to Dubrovnik. 

1) Being an EU citizen, can I cross the border with just my ID-card/passport? I've read up on it and got the impression that there would be no need for a visa or such.

2) Should I go by bus, rent a car, or over sea (from Split)?

Thank you",travel

I plan on taking as many routes as possible by train. Bialystok seems to be the best option for a stop between Vienna and Vilnius, as the train from there to Vilnius via Kaunas leaves in the afternoon, there is some time to spend before midday. The only fixed part is Stockholm, which i already visited once and where 1 have to spend 1,5 days for a conference.  I'm not sure if there is something in the Baltics i really need to see or how usefull my plan for Finland is. I thought of adding a day for Falun for hiking and already know most other parts of Sweden. I could start one day earlier to add one day somewhere inbetween.",travel

Qantas displays my purchase as the former, however I am pretty sure I will be given boarding passes that indicate the latter.

[USA] Best National Park to visit from California WITHOUT A CAR ?,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I am based in San Francisco and I would like to spend some time with my gf in nature. Since we are in the USA, I guess it means a  National Park.

What makes it a bit more complex though is that we can't legally drive a car in the USA.  

Do you have any recommendation for a National Park that you can enjoy without a car ?  Bonus point if it is not too far from SF, for economical, ecological and time costs.  

For reference, Yosemite and Zion are 2 parks I would love to visit one day.

India Visa Help: US citizen applying for 10 year visa (Plus continuing to SEAsia),"Hello all,
This will be my first time traveling out of the US other than some minor resort excursions as a kid and I could use some advice. It seems like i decided to jump off the deep end with this one...

I will be traveling to India and Southeast Asia between October 2019 and April 2020. I have the first 5 weeks planned — I’m sitting a 10 day meditation course and then going on a 3 week pilgrimage to sacred sites in Northern India and Nepal. Beyond that, I’d like to continue traveling in India  for about a month before continuing on to Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and maybe Vietnam? It all really depends on how much I’m able to save up before leaving and how much I enjoy prolonged international travel. Maybe I’ll want to come home after 3 months, maybe I’ll get to April and want to keep going (I’m thinking of applying for the Australia/New Zealand under 30 work visa and heading out there after I’m done in SEAsia). For reference, I’ve been living in my Subaru Outback for the last year traveling around the West Coast working and exploring, so I have at least dipped my toes into minimal/itinerant living.

I am looking at applying for the Indian 10 year multi entry visa for US citizens that allows you to stay for 6 months at a stretch (ill want to have the option to be in India for longer than 2 months so the tourist EVisa wont work).

I have booked a multi city flight into New Delhi 10/11/2019, and out of Bangkok 4/1/2020. I am not certain that I will actually board the 2nd leg of that flight, but it was a cheap way to book and gives me plenty of breathing room to travel freely.

So, for the India Visa I know I need to submit an itinerary with my application that covers entry place, places I’ll be visiting in sequence, and exit place. I know when I’ll be entering and what I’ll be doing for the first 5 weeks, but beyond that I was hoping to leave it largely up in the air. How closely does my itinerary need to resemble where I really end up? Can I just pick a likely point/date of exit or must this be accurate? 

Also, I have heard that I need to be able to display my continuing travel plans upon entering India, otherwise I may be denied entry to the country altogether. Will my return flight from Bangkok to the US in April qualify, or do I need to book a flight out of India inside the 6 month window of my visa? Does this flight need to match what my Visa application itinerary states?

Am I crazy for trying to figure this all out without a travel agent?

Any additional travel advice/tips you’d like to share about the countries I’ve mentioned? Any advice on Visas and border crossings (I haven’t even started looking into this for countries other than India)?

Thanks so much for any help, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with the planning at the moment. Hoping 3 months is enough time to plan this whole thing out.",travel

Confused about SBB Swiss Travel Pass in Berner Oberland,"My friend and I are backpacking across Switzerland in August and we're picking up the 15-day Swiss Travel Pass to get around.

However I think this only applies to transit operated by SBB CFF FFS. Does anyone know if it covers cable cars and gondolas from, say, Mürren to Gimmelwald? Or Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp? Or is there a discount with these routes, since they're likely operated by a different company?

"I’m going on my annual holiday to Spain soon, and looking at getting a travel card, any recommendations or advice on using one? Also any security tips for home while I’m not there?","TLDR is the question, not much else to add except that I’m in the UK and renting a room (I’m a lodger) so the security isn’t all over my house, mostly just for my room.

Longer version: I tend to go away every year, I’m fairly lucky that my grandparents and Aunt brought villas in Spain years ago so me and my cousin (who I’m traveling with) have places to stay on holiday, all our flights are sorted out as she works for an airline and did all of that stuff for me, I just need to pack and sort my travel money.

Normally when I travel there I only stay for 4-7 days and don’t go to the beach (villa is opposite a private pool) so having a travel card isn’t really something I need as I pay cash everywhere. This time though I’m actually going out there for 2 weeks and my cousin loves the beach so we’ll be going there a lot, I’m planning on taking half my money in cash (for markets and small purchases) and half on a travel card (for any larger purchases, general shopping and the beach). I know nothing about travel cards, except that they work like a bank card that you top up. So if I could have some recommendations for them, and people’s personal experiences with using them that would be great.

Home wise, I’m lodging in a house with a couple and their brother, so I just wanna make sure that my room isn’t messed around with, I’m having a huge tidy up before I go anyway and I literally have nothing valuable at all (the most expensive thing I own is an old laptop), and I’m switching off all my plugs before I go away so there’s no reason to rent go in my room. I grew up sharing a house with 4 siblings so I just don’t really like leaving my stuff alone as I’m always scared people are gonna touch it.",travel

Flying with a camera bag and confused about some of the restrictions.,"I'm sure this is probably somewhat covered in the FAQ. I promise I read through and did some preliminary searches. I couldn't find answers to my questions specifically.

So, this will be my first time traveling with my photographic equipment and the whole process has me really anxious. I am flying with Allegiant to a neighboring state in the U.S.

* I have a fairly standard Canon DSLR battery and double A rechargeable batteries for my flash / slaves. The website says that all batteries must be installed. I assume that means that it's okay to leave the batteries in the gear? In my head, \*installed\* makes me think of something that can't be removed--hence my confusion.
* Above all, the carry on size requirements are really confusing. It says that the maximum size is 9 x 14 x 22 inches.  From what I understand, this is pretty standard. However, they also say that  ""This measurement includes wheels, pockets, handles and decorations. The carry-on bag must fit in the overhead compartment."" With a camera *bag* this is a little confusing because the pockets of air between the straps and the ground can create at least an inch of width, especially if the left and right straps are crossed underneath the bag. The product dimensions on Amazon and BH Photo, however, show the exterior to be within the limits - 22 x 10.5 x 8"" (55.9 x 26.7 x 20.3cm). Should I expect problems with this bag?

- a few days to explore Edinburgh
- a few days in the Highlands or an Isle (most popular of course being Isle of Skye)
- a few days in Glasgow

Tips for travelling through Ukraine on an overnight train,"Hello guys, me and my buddy are travelling to Ukraine in about 10 days. As we land in Kharkov and stay in Ukraine for 1 week we decided to take an overnight train to Kiev. I've found a few tickets online that are quite cheap for a sleeper cabine ~ $15. It's for 2nd class sleeper and i just want to know if anyone has been on a train in Ukraine. What should we expect from 2nd class sleeper, will we be able to sleep there, what should we bring with us on the train, is it safe to travel this way and is 1st class worth it. What are your tips in general for Ukrainian trains and what to avoid?",travel

Any advice on spending new years in LA or LasVegas with younger kids?,"I need your help to plan our California Trip around x-mas. First of let me tell you who we are. We are Europeans, and some of us lived on the east coast for many years. So we are pretty well-adapted, but we have not been in the US for ten years and cant wait to experience the fantastic food and culture we love so much. We are 2 Families with four kids, ages 3,5,7 and11.

We are foodies and water-rats, and we are not so keen on walking, hiking or to much exercise. And yes, I am a fatass ;o)

Our budget, not including the flights and the Vegas Airbnb, is about $5.000 to $6.000. 

&amp;#x200B;

   So far we got the following sorted out.

23rd of December: We arrive in San Francisco and spend the night

24th: We fly to Las Vegas and got ti Airbnb places near MGM tower

24th-30th Vegas, grand canyon and whatever we decide to do

30th: We get some rental cars and drive to Los Angeles (maybe)

30th-4th: We have no plans at all

4th: We fly from SF back to Europe

&amp;#x200B;

Now is the time we need your help. 

Should we stay in Vegas for the new year or should we go to LA? 

Where is a good place to go with the kids to celebrate the new year?

Disney?

In which area of LA should we get the Airbnb?

Any better ideas?

Looking for suggestions for time in Bavaria and Western Austria mid September,"My SO and I are flying into Frankfurt Mid September, with the intention of renting a car, driving down the Romantic Road into Austria, staying in Innsbruck for a few days, then driving up to Munich for Oktoberfest.  We have 9 days between Frankfurt and Munich that are still flexible.

Day 4 - 5 Augsburg

Day 5 - 6 Neuschwanstein Castle

Day 6 - 9 Innsbruck/Western Austria

Day 9 - 11 Munich and fly home

We came up with this rough itinerary mostly through googling, and we don't necessarily want to spend the whole time going to churches and castles, which all of the ""24 hours in x"" seem to really point to.  Obviously we want to do a bit of that, but also hike, enjoy some night life, make some random friends, potentially a mountain bike ride or two, and move around our multi night stays if it would be the right call.  Really my wife is afraid we're gonna end up in a small town with nothing going on at night ha and nothing but guided tours during the day.  Any locations we should add or remove?  Should Neuschwanstein or any other spots be just a stop between locations vs an overnight?  Should we stay an extra day in RobT or Augsburg vs somewhere else?  I know Innsbruck is a little smaller, are we spending too much time there?

A Travel Guide to Romania. The Urban Version,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I’m posting this here and cross-posting it with /r/Romania as I’ve seen tons of tourists roaming through Bucharest, among many other places in Romania.   


Some of you might think about getting a small city break, others might not know about Bucharest, but are tired that all the major attractions are already overcrowded and don’t know where to go.

So come to Romania. We’re okay, I promise.

This post might be subjective as it’s my point of view. But I hope other redditors will come with good info. You can read a wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/wiki/travel/#wiki_a_basic_travel_guide_to_romania), but it was last updated in March 2018.

I will post info here as I would like to see it when I first come to a new place. 

A short brief about me just to get an idea. Male, going on 30, urban professional, kinda into the whole alternative-underground-artsy thing. You know the type. I’m pretty urbanized myself, so I prefer to have a 4G network and decent services wherever I go.

So, first things first.

* Romania is in Eastern Europe and it’s pretty amazing. Still undiscovered by tourists, you can roam around the country and the people will be nice and eager to help. We like tourists, you’re cool. Before you leave, check the weather. As it’s July now, the entire country is pretty hot. Bucharest is hotter than hell now, as there is no wind, lots of buildings and asphalt. Don’t sit in the sun during the day and be a Hydro Homie. 
* When you arrive at the Henry Coanda Airport you can order an Uber, Bolt (local version of Uber), taxis through the StarTaxi and Clever taxi app or directly at the entrance. A ride from the airport to the city center shouldn’t cost more than $10-$15 (40-50 lei). 
* Don’t change a lot of money at the airport. Just like in any other country, the rates are crap.
* Just as a brief overview, $1 is about 4 lei, 1 euro is about 5 lei. 
* Never (like never, never) get a cab from the side of the road. They’re not dangerous or anything, but some of them might try to haggle over the price of the ride and you don't need that in your life.
* If you’re from the EU, you can use your own phone sim card. If you’re from outside of the EU, just buy a pre-paid sim. It costs about $5 and you’ll pretty much have unlimited internet. I would recommend Vodafone as it has the best connection. 
* There are tons of hotels, hostels, AirBnb’s and so on. Just pick one that doesn’t look shady.
* Speaking of shady. We’re not shady. Bucharest is one of the safest cities in Europe. We rarely have violent crimes, people don’t chase you with knives on the street (what’s up London? Still stabbing?) You can walk around the city at night without having to be afraid of being mugged. Just stay out of the rough neighborhoods and you’ll be all right. Avoid Ferentari, Rahova, and Giulesti. These are ghettos and you don’t have anything to see there. The most annoying people are beggars, but they just yap around aggressively, but won’t do anything. Just don’t look too touristy and you’ll go unnoticed.
* Most of the people under 40 (and many above that age) are fluent in English and probably another European language. They’ll happily help you in case you’re lost or need directions. 
* Use the subway. Our subway system is pretty good and clean. Take buses and trams only if you feel adventurous.
* During daytime, you can take a couple of walking tours across Bucharest. There are both free and paid tours that cover pretty much everything. From the history of the city, its’ Communist era, nightlife, underground life and so on. Just google it. I would recommend you do that in the first days to get accustomed to the city. As I mentioned before, Bucharest has more to offer than it looks. 
* If you want to see the Palace of the Parliament, the MNAC (National Museum of Contemporary Art) has a terrace on the top floor. It’s relatively unknown, as many locals don’t know about it. A beer is about 7-10 lei, wine is about 15 lei. Don’t go there during mid-day. It is fucking hot.
* Gradina cu Filme is also a great place. Pretty quiet and cozy, is great for a beer or two. Which by the way costs about 8 lei. 
* During the evening you can visit the Unirii Fountain. It was recently renovated and it offers quite a show. Usually, the streets are closed around them during the weekends and they have light &amp; music shows 2 or 3 times a night. You can find some cool videos on YouTube. 
* Food. You can find everything, everywhere, at any hour. Seriously. If you want to feel the local vibe, try a shaworma or some mici. The best mici are at Obor (can’t say for sure, not a big fan myself).
* Nightlife. Wooh, geez. A lot of it, everywhere, until morning. It depends on what you like. Saturdays are the best, even though you can find tons of people during weeknights too. I would suggest you take a walk through the Old Town to see the vibe, but that place’s nasty. All the kitsch of Bucharest is gathered in one place. But I would recommend Mojo though, or other clubs/bars that are not on the main streets of the Old Town. Do a small research before. I usually go Control, Expirat, Apollo111 or Eden. Can’t say the music is great, but you will find a lot of interesting people to chat with. During the peak nights (Fridays and Saturdays) there are a lot of tourists. 
* The drinks in pubs and clubs are fairly priced. The beer costs from 7 lei and cocktails about 15-25 lei.
* I know our alcohol is cheap, but don’t forget to hydrate. Don’t ruin your evening and the day after. 
* Let’s talk about drugs. Recreational ones are fairly easy to find, but don’t get caught. Romania still has zero tolerance on drugs and you don’t want to spend the rest of your night in a police station. Even though you can get by with a small “fine” for good ol’ 420.
* Since it’s summertime, you can go visit the seaside. The beaches are at a 2-3 hour drive from Bucharest. Please take the train (private ones, not the onest from CFR), or go with a local. You need to be from around here to know how to drive in Romania. If you still decide to drive, take the highway. Avoid the rush hours as the road will be very entertaining, but not in a pleasant way.
* You can go either to Mamaia (lots of various clubs, more on the Techno, Minimal, something something scene), or go to Vama Veche. Vama Veche is more of the hippy, creative, alternative place. A couple of rock bars, lots of hipsterish places for yuppies. The vibe is pretty great both during the day and by night. Go there on weekends to get the best parties. 
* You can find tons of hotels or camping sites in Vama Veche. I can recommend Sandalandala. You can rent a tent/sleeping bag/ mattress there and interact with people. Their bathrooms and showers are decent, food is not bad (not excellent either, but hey - Vama is made for drinking, not fine dining). Prices are okay.
* Vama is all about food and having fun. The beaches are pretty crappy, so don’t expect to have spectacular views. But the parties tho’. Do wait to see the sunrise on the beach. It’s sort of a local tradition. 
* During the day you can sit at the beach and just enjoy a drink or two. A sunbed starts from about 20 lei a day.

I hope you’ll find this useful.

Very Confused by Amsterdam Public Transit,"I am desperately trying to find out how this OV-Chipkaart thing works and how much travel actually costs.

We will also be travelling outside the city on a day or two and I am 99% sure this card is accepted on everything but again pricing is elusive. Trying to determine if it's worth it to get the card and pay by the ride or just get the City Card which only works on GVB buses, trams, and metros but not the train or night buses.

Is Hotwire.com trustworthy?,"I was about to book a hotel on Hotwire.com but did a quick Google search first and found some not-so-favorable reveiws of their services. However, most of them revolved around the hotel not having their reservation when they arrived and I would think as long as I call to confirm that the hotel has my reservation ahead of time that wouldn't be an issue. The other issue I kept reading about is Hotwire placing people in hotels that aren't as many stars as they were promised, not in the right area, etc. But those were for completely blind bookings and the deal I am wanting to book guarantees that I will be placed in one of four hotels and they are all satisfactory to me. So I am wondering if there are other issues with hotwire.com that should make me reconsider using them? If it's legit it will save me $100+. Thank you!",travel
Recommend me a shoe for city walking!,"Female, 5'1, 60kgs. 

I can't tell if it's just me but... I think I just have some really bad luck with shoes or I'm just not doing/considering something right. I generally do a lot of walking whenever I travel and have worn various, I would say pretty reputable shoes, however, I always get tired in them waay sooner than I expect and it's just such a bummer to have the energy to still keep on exploring but your feet are holding you back, ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I thought I'd list down the shoes I have tried walking/travelling with in the past and how they have fared for me (in no particular order). Curious to find out of anybody else have the same experience with some of these shoes and what recommendations for shoes you have. I don't specifically have a budget right now, I'm just really looking to get me the pair of shoes I know I will love and will bring me to more places! Here goes: -

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Skechers GoWalk3 Unfold** \- So far, these shoes have been the most comfortable for me but I have some qualms with its durability. After a 2 weeks Euro trip of mostly walking they were pretty flat/compressed. I thought, ""ok yea what do you expect, you did a lot of walking of course they're compressed"" but after that, they were just never the same. They just felt like flats to me. Not long after they just started to reek, and I had to wash them thrice and even threw it into a super hot dryer and baked it in my car parked under the hot sun for a solid 2 weeks to get the stink off for my trip to Japan in winter. They were decent smelling but damn, after like 2 days of walking it just reeked again and I realized maybe it's just the whole memory foam thing and inability to pull out the soles. Anyway, it was sad to see those shoes go- I left them in Vietnam after wanting to give it a chance one last time but they were too far gone and I guess I am just taken aback by its lack of durability to hold up 2 weeks worth of walking (and the SMELL).
2. **Nike Roshe One** \- I wouldn't say I knew much about sneakers then but I had plenty of friends swearing their lives upon these shoes and how comfortable they are. It was like a no brainer for me to get them but was fairly disappointed with these - I actually had to double check if they were originals after wearing them for a few months because I thought to myself, ""this *CAN'T* be the shoe everyone's raving about right!?"" I brought them to Singapore and almost instantly regretted it. I went to get Scholl insoles for them and plugged them right in. They were just ok after but it kind of felt like it defeated the purpose of getting these pair of shoes specifically in the first place. I truly learned the importance of an arch support from these pair of shoes. 
3. **Adidas Pureboost X -** I've heard greeaat things about the boosts and thought I'd give it a go! Finally! Friggin shoes with an emphasis on the arch support! Must be a winner, right!? But eh, I just came back from Singapore over the weekend and they tired me out fairly quickly as well. I wouldn't even say I did much walking this time even. I went to Skechers to try out the new GoWalks and thought I would just revert back to those but after having some form of arch support on the boosts, comparatively, the boosts still felt better so it didn't make sense for me to fork out the cash for new GoWalks. Today is a Wednesday and my feet still hurt from just the little bit of walking I did over the weekend.
4. **Converse All Star Low Top -** I just wanted a casual pair of black shoes I didn't plan to walk in much during a recent trip to Vietnam because I knew I was going to be on a bike most of the time so I really didn't expect to do much walking at all. However from whatever little walking I did eg. walking to a restaurant less than 1km away to get dinner, quick walkaround a small town for a break etc really wore my feet out. I even just reverted to some cheap Vietnamese sandals and those felt better-ish? How?!

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm heading to London for 3 weeks and I just plan to do lots of walking but I can't even begin to think of what shoes to even bring at this point in time given my experience. I've done some research and was considering looking into getting either Allbirds, New Balances, Merrells or really splurging that cash on Ultraboosts (...?) I will have a bigger variety &amp; accessibility to more brands in the UK (I've never even heard of Allbirds up til today - I'm from Malaysia) so it'll be a great opportunity to get one when I'm there. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Any recommendations or tips you guys have would be greatly appreciated. I'm thinking what I need is a light, durable shoe with good arch support and isn't going to break anyone's bank.

Paris- 7 days

Yes, the itinerary is ambitious but I did try to allocate at least 5 days for all major cities. Is there any place I should take out or add? Perhaps London or Paris is too long? Wengen/Skye also seems a bit long but both sites are a bitch to travel into and out of. Another thing to add is that we have to start in Barcelona (SO heading there first with her family) and end in Paris (anniversary)...everything else is fair game.",travel
Where can I be immersed in a new culture without too much travel time?!,"My boyfriend and I were planning a two week trip to Peru in September/October.

How do you decide where to travel next when you have limited holidays?,"So I get 4 weeks holiday per year which I always use for international holidays, but the problem is there are so many places I want to visit and I don’t know how to decide!

Another problem is that I live so far away from everything. For example, Europe is two 10-12 hour flights away, Asia is ~10 hours away so it takes ages to actually get anywhere.",travel

Arriving in Russia just before visa is valid,"-Have a trip to Russia in a few weeks. 
-Had to change flights.
-Without thinking, booked flight that arrives at 20:30 *the night before* my visa is valid. 
-Have called airline, they'll let me know tomorrow whether I can still board. 

My question is, assuming I can board, what will happen when I get to Moscow:
-Will customs just say YOLO and let me through early? 
-Will I have to wait around for 3 hours before going through? 
-Will I be deported as an illegal alien?

Does my girlfriend have dengue fever?,"Hey travel peeps,

For anyone who has travelled S/E Asia and Bali (where we are now) you would have heard about the scary sicknesses you can get. I need some advice. About 2 weeks ago she was bit by a wild cat. We immediately went and followed through with the rabies vaccines. She got 2 shots right away and was scheduled for a third in a couple weeks. We went up to the north of bali, Lovina. Took us a while to find a place to give her the shot but we did it. Literally the day after she was experiencing terrible muscle pain, headaches (pain behind the eyes), and she was really hot. I immediately did a bit of searching and thought that it was a reaction to the shot. We rode out the day and I gave her some tylenol and paracetamol but it didn't seem to work very well so we decided to go to the hospital in Singaraja. The doctor took her vitals and weirdly enough she didn't have a fever. The doctor said the shot wasn't the culprit because the was fine with the first 2. Curious what this bug was we got a blood test. It came back normal. I questioned the doctor about possible dengue and she said that the white blood cells were at normal level so if the symptoms get worse to come back and get another test. We got some pills and went home. After the pills she felt a whole lot better in the morning. Almost back to normal, just tired. Now about 3 days have gone by and the headaches and muscle pain is gone but she is exhausted and nauseous all the time. My question is has anyone experienced something similar and should we ride it out or go get some more tests at a clinic. I think I will take her to a clinic today, but I thought maybe the symptoms were better. Either way please feel free to share any experience or advice on this. Thanks!

Itinerary Advice (Am Torn),"Hey everyone,

Is Instagram dictating the way we travel? Shouldn't travelling be about connecting with people rather than selfies at tourist checkpoints?,"Usually I travel with 1-2 friends and very often I find myself doing the standard tourist stuff like a selfie in front of Eiffel Tower, a meal at burger and lobster, or going up the London eye. These are all things that locals rarely do. I've always preferred to travel to cities where I have friends there, but unfortunately, I do not have friends all over the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, it's nice to have a super IG-able photo from a trip, but I also want to make a local friend also. When I travel, I can't help but to wonder what people's opinions are on their country's recent politics, economics, disruptions, etc... I want to know if the 'Top 10 must try' restaurant list I read up online are really what the local people eat. There's such a big discrepancy between how a tourist sees a city and how a local sees it. Do you feel somewhat like an outsider when traveling? Would it feel nicer to have a local friend?

- Good for packing for at least 7 days travel. Doesn't have to be HUGE but needs to be bigger than a carry on. I have a couple of decent carry on options right now including a LV Keepall 45 and a Tumi backpack so I just need a bag for extended stay.

- Higher quality material (currently have a Swiss Gear bag which isn't horrible but I want to upgrade). 

- Black, gray, dark blue, or some other masculine color (i.e. I don't want anything pink or lime green basically).

- I don't like hardshell because it shows scratches too easily.

Peru Itinerary- 12 Days,"Any thoughts or advice is appreciated! Traveling in late August - early September.

Day 1- Fly into Lima from Dulles. Land at 7:30 pm. Check into Airbnb in Miraflores and relax.

Day 2- Market tour/fruit tasting/cooking class with SkyKitchen. Explore Lima- Kennedy Park (cats!), Costa Verde, historic buildings, have a nice dinner and a few drinks out.

Day 3- PeruHop bus to Paracas (Ballestas Island boat tour) and Huacachina (dune buggy and sand boarding).

Day 4- Morning flight to Cusco. Check into Hotel Rumi Punku. Wander around Cusco- Plaza de Armas, Sacsayhuaman. Mostly take it easy to adjust to altitude...maybe get a massage at our hotel.

Day 5- Morning train to Aguas Calientes. Butterfly park? Check into Airbnb. Afternoon ticket into Machu Picchu.

Day 6- Morning ticket into Machu Picchu + Huayna Picchu hike. Afternoon train back to Cusco. Check into Airbnb in San Blas.

Day 7- This day is up in the air depending on how we're feeling. Would really love to see Moray and the Maras salt mines. We've seen Sacred Valley day tours that include Pisac, Maras salt mines, Moray, and Ollantaytambo...but not sure if that is too much ""on the go"". A local option in Cusco would be a chocolate workshop.

Day 8- Would really like to hike to Humantay Lake if we are up for it.

Day 9- Noon flight to Puerto Maldonado. Travel to Chuncho Lodge in Tambopata to begin 4 day, 3 night tour (Macaws Clay Lick &amp; Lake Sandoval). Canopy tower, night jungle walk.

Day 10- Macaw clay lick in Tambopata National Reserve. Jungle walk.

Day 11- Sandoval Lake.

Day 12- Sandoval Lake and travel back to Puerto Maldonado. Flight back to Lima. Flight back to Dulles.

We are young and prefer active vacations, but don't want things to be so fast-paced that we are exhausted and feel like we're rushing around each day. I tend to get a little ambitious when planning because I want to experience as much as possible while there (within reason). Would love to stay in Peru longer, but due to PTO limitations, this is the best we can do.

I would also love any thoughts/perspectives on altitude sickness- I am very anxious about this. We will be getting our yellow fever vaccines soon, and consulting with the doctor about possible malaria meds as well (though I heard those can have some bad side effects). Also, is using a money belt for passports and emergency cash worth it/necessary? I have a travel backpack I usually carry my camera in, and was considering getting a backpack lock, but not sure what is smart and what is overkill- we're reasonably smart/aware travelers, but better safe than sorry? We plan to exchange some dollars to soles before we fly into Lima. All our hotels/Airbnbs offer airport pickup, so we'll mostly use that, but may need a taxi/Uber here and there. I've heard mixed information about using Uber in Peru, though. We're brushing up on some basic Spanish before traveling and have the Lonely Planet Peru book. We love photography and trying local cuisine/beverages. Any other travel/packing tips and restaurant or activity recommendations are much appreciated!",travel

I’m visiting northern California at the end of July. I’ll be staying in the Sonora/Columbia area and flying into San Francisco. My plans include renting a car and traveling between SF, San Jose, Sacramento, and Yosemite.

I’m mainly wondering, what are some of the beaten path things to do in these areas? I love antique shops and weird collections of things so any kind of strange shops are right up my alley. I’m planning to hike Glacier Point trail, but if there are other trails nearby that are easy to hike (not much escalation or dangerous cliffs) I’d love recommendations on those too. I’m also interested in seeing a sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Where are some top but under the radar spots to do this? I’ll be traveling solo as well, so I’m open to any ideas.

Thanks for any and all help!",travel
Where to go in 2020?,"Hi everyone! I need advice about where to travel to! I love travelling and seeing new places!

Thanks!

**Poland (and surrounds);**

Have never been to Eastern Europe before, would like to see Auschwitz.

Am not sure of safety/security with the current political situation (don't know if it's exaggerated in the news)

Seems to be cheap which is good

Have been before (two weeks ago, lol)

Haven't seen eastern coast/Valencia

Barcelona seems cool!

Seems the political situation has cooled down

**Japan (with China/South Korea/Russia???):**

Tokyo fascinates the tech-y side of me

Mount Fuji would be very special

Interested in the culture

(Seoul and the DMZ would be an option as it's so near)

Advice needed from people who have experienced post-travel depression,"I’m on my final day before I fly home from my five-week long trip to Canada. I’m from the UK, so a trip so far away is something I’d never done before (especially by myself). It was my first time outside Europe too. 

I’ve stayed with a friend and her family who until five weeks ago I’d only met one irl for a single day in the 7 years we’ve known each other. It’s been hands down the best time of my life. 

I can’t bare the thought of going home. 

I’ve pushed it so far down I’ve ignored the feeling of dread, but it’s here now and it’s not going anywhere. 

It’s just. I’m so unhappy in my home country. I’d move here if I could but it’s honestly just not feasible for a multitude of reasons. 

I likely won’t be able to return for another year or so, seeing as travelling is expensive (especially to a place so far from home) and I haven’t really got any ways of earning extra money on top of my current full-time job. 

My friend and her family and friends have made me feel so welcome, and shown me a time I’ll never forget. I don’t want to go back to how unhappy and hated I feel in the UK. 

But I have to go back. If anyone has any advice on coping with having to say goodbye, and dealing with being home after a long trip (especially after your first long trip) it would be greatly appreciated, because right now I feel like the ground is going to swallow me whole.",travel

Traveling with a guitar Stockholm-Buenos Aires. Swiss Airlines to Zurich/ Edelweiss Air Zurich-Buenos Aires,"Hello. Has anyone travelled with a guitar with these companies I mentioned in the title?

From what I read the obvious choice is to send it in the cargo area. However this guitar belonged to my father's dad and I'm terribly afraid it will not arrive safely due to it being possibly thrown around at the BA airport. I'm Argentinian so I know how they handle items. I'm also afraid it will simply be taken as it's an expensive guitar and the hard case looks expensive as well. Two very real possibilities that would break my husband's heart. 

With a gig bag (and not the hard case) the guitar is about 106cms tall, 36cms wide at the curviest part, and 8cms deep. 

I'm not sure it will fit in the overhead compartment. I know I can ask to put it in the coat hanger. It all depends on the airline's willingness to help. So, I'm unsure about these airlines. If they have a history of cooperation or exactly the opposite.

Travel Tips for Greece,"Hi team,

Heading to Greece in a few weeks and was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into the following areas:

-is it common to pay with credit or should we be using mainly cash? Research online is giving mixed opinions and much of it is quite dated.

-What is the wifi situation like? I thought I read online that wifi is accessible almost anywhere in Greece, but recent searches aren't turning up the same information.

-Can someone explain the plug adapter/voltage converter situation? Do I need a plug adapter and a step-down converter to adjust the voltage from 220 to 120, or will just a plug adapter suffice? Thinking specifically for hair straighteners, as I believe chargers for phones and laptops auto-detect and adapt to the different voltage.

-What is the ferry system like? A friend travelled to Greece 15 years ago and said it was quite unpredictable. Is that still the case or do they follow a more consistent schedule now? Which ferry company would be the most highly recommended in terms of reliability? 

-Any other bits of information you might think useful.

"Is Myrtle Beach (SC, USA) Really That Bad?","Hi! I have already booked a few days down there at the end of August with my sister as the flights were cheap and we wanted to go to a beach. 

I'm now looking into what the area is like, where we can go eat, etc., and it looks like there are a lot of unfavorable opinions on this location! Some things I don't care about for the purpose of this trip. For example, people say there's no culture or historical attractions. We just plan to hang out on the beach, eat and drink, and maybe just get a taste of some night life (my sister will be barely 21!). That said we are not huge party animals.

I'm interested in your general opinion, but some things I'm wondering are:

Would you say the beaches are nice enough to spend most of our time there? How is the swimming? I'm guessing at the end of August itll be fairly crowded, but is it like, no-room-to-even-put-a-towel-down crowded?

Is it generally safe to stay on the main drag? I chose a less than stellar hotel a few blocks further north than the main tourist center in order to get a decent price for a place right on the beach, is that generally pretty walkable at night?

"2 days in Santa Marta, Colombia. Looking for day trip recommendations","Title says it.  

TL;DR at the top: 2 days in Santa Marta, looking for links to book day trips to Tayrona Park and Minca.

We'll be in Colombia for 1 week in total, for a wedding in Cartagena on Saturday.  We arrive Tuesday afternoon, and were planning to go straight to Santa Marta for Wednesday and Thursday.  

Ideally we'd like to do 2 day trips, potentially to Tayrona Park and Minca (but are open to suggestions) and are looking for links to day trips.  Preferrably for Tayrona Park we'd like something along the lines of jungle hike to a beach where we can relax and then return.  Not interested in snorkeling/scuba diving/etc, but want to take in the scenery. Is this something we need to purchase a tour for? 

For Minca I've seen a couple tours online that include a stop at La Victoria coffee farm which seemed cool, but am curious if anyone has any experience with this, or could suggest another tour/or way to visit Minca.  We definitely want to see the big hammocks.  

Also, for either of these, is it recommended to book lodging in Santa Marta and use that as a base?  Any advice is welcome!",travel

Help! I can't decide where to go from Madrid in February!,"So, I got a steal of a flight deal to Madrid this coming February and can't decide where to go from there.

I've saved a bunch of Norwegian cabins in my Airbnb account that I would want to visit ""someday"" but I don't think driving in Norway in the winter would be too great of an idea. Another part of me wants to stay in Spain and see something unique there. I love the outdoors adventures and atypical experiences but I don't know which way to turn. I love history but know so little about Spain it is embarrassing. My wife thinks that I only go to places that I have a historical knowledge of but that I could learn about Spain in the leadup to it...and she has a point.

"Looking for advice for a British Columbia, Canada camping trip","Next week a group of 5 people, including myself, want to a camping/hiking roadtrip somewhere in B.C, Canada.

The plan is to drive out of Seattle late afternoon (around 3pm) on Wednesday and get back into Seattle by Sunday night. The most we are looking to drive is 8hr away from Seattle. We want to camp everyday and are looking for some really intense hikes (like ones that have up to 5,000-6,000ft of elevation gain). We do not want to go backpacking

We are also looking for places in B.C that offer a little more than just hiking/camping. For example, maybe a lake to go swimming in or activities such as whitewater rafting (the only problem is that it has to be relatively cheap, a few of us are on a budget). Basically, we're open to pretty much anything outdoors

**Any suggestions?**

-------

Here are a few places we were considering, thoughts on these would be great too

1) Mt Robson. **Pros**: Epic views, **Cons**: There doesn't seem much to do here other than hiking

2) Check out the Bridal Veils Provincial Park, Othello tunnels, Kawkawa Lake, Ladner Creek trestle. **Pros**: Seems like a lot of do in this area, **Cons** This is very close to Seattle so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to ""waste"" a long weekend here when we could theoretically check out this place another time on any normal weekend

3) Vancouver Island. We would take a ferry from Vancouver to Nanaimo and drive about 2hr north of Nanaimo for some hiking. **Pros**: Vancouver Island has cool little towns, great hikes, and it's near water to relax at. **Cons**: It's too late to reserve a ferry and we're worried about missing a ferry to get back into Vancouver. Even if we get to the ferry on-time, our concern is that we still might not get it if the ferry fills up. We absolutely have to be back in Seattle by Sunday night

But last time i flown with them was back in 2016 and it is now 2019. Back in 2016 you were able to bring one free carry on bag ... but i now checked out flights in 2019 ... now i see they are only allowing one free personal item like a purse or small backpack or brief case.",travel
Porto Metro (Hopping on and off allowed?),"Hi,

Can somebody confirm that if I buy a normal Z2 ticket for the Porto Meto that I would be able to hop on and off the metro as many times as I wish within 1hr? [https://en.metrodoporto.pt/pages/397](https://en.metrodoporto.pt/pages/397)

Kenya: Amboseli or Hells Gate in October?,"Hello! Everyone was so helpful the last time I posted, I wanted to ask another question for those with experience in Kenya!

I will be doing an overland trip from Cape Town to Nairobi, spending a week or two in Uganda as well. I have a free day on October 18 in Nairobi and I really want to take a day trip to either Hells Gate National Park (would likely be one of the bike day tours) OR Amboseli National Park for Kilimanjaro views specifically. During the tour I'll be taking, we only pass by Kili once in the late afternoon, and it's basically our one shot to see the mountain. So I'd see Amboseli as a second chance to see Kilimanjaro, but I know id be disappointed if it doesn't show. Hells Gate also seems to have a following of people who love it, and it was where I was originally planning to go before thinking on the odds of seeing Mt Kilimanjaro...

Where do you recommend I go? Hells Gate or Amboseli? Is there even decent odds of seeing Kilimanjaro from Amboseli if visited as a day trip?

Thoughts on the matter are super appreciated!",travel
Has anybody EVER had a Greyhound bus be on time?,"I honestly don't understand how consistently unreliable this service is.

I've used 3 or 4 different stations dozens of times, and am not kidding when I say every single departure by a Greyhound bus in my experience has been delayed.

Not sure what I'm looking to get out of this post... does anybody else suffer the same fate as I? Will Greyhound ever become a respectable service and/or how can we hold them more accountable? It's not even like the tickets are cheap or the seats are comfortable....

"Venice: Venezia Unica pass and ""skip the line"" access?","We'll be going to Venice later this month. I've been researching the various options for the [Venezia unica](http://www.veneziaunica.it/en) city pass. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether the admissions it includes would entitle us for ""skip the line"" or ""priority"" access, which would be quite a bonus for some crowded places like the Doge palace. Some sites like [this one](https://www.turbopass.de/venedig-city-pass) explicitly advertise ""skip the line"" access (but the city passes they sell are substantially more expensive and less configurable), whereas the Venezia Unica web site doesn't mention anything like it - at least I was unable to find it.

Connecting to an International Flight at IAD,"Hey all, 

I'm planning to fly from Denver to Brussels in October and I found a well-priced flight round-trip through Brussels Air that connects at IAD. I'd have 2hr40m for my connection on the way to Brussels, and a 1hr40m connection on the way back to Denver. 

So a couple questions: with a checked bag, are these connection times too narrow? Would I have to go through security again during my connection, or go through customs? My domestic flights are operated by United but would be purchased through the Brussels Air website.

"Europe itinerary suggestions, questions and critique - First time in Europe!","Hello r/Travel! I'm looking for comments and suggestions on how to improve my European trip itinerary before I purchase and finalize everything. My spouse and I are teachers, and we are planning on taking this trip during our 2020 summer break. This will be our first long, out of country trip and our first time in Europe. 

We tried to give ourselves sufficient time in each city, however, since we live very very far away from Europe, we also wanted to see as much as we could while we were there. (It costs quite a bit to get Europe from where we live.)

We're planning on purchasing a month long rail pass. Is it worth it to upgrade to first class? 

We may be going too many places but I'm not sure what to cut or expand. I'm up for any suggestions! We wanted to add in Cinque Terre and Tuscany but this itinerary is already looking a wild. Are there any more must see cities? We want to keep the entire trip under 40 days and under $10,000 total.

Asking for advice/help for trip to Mallorca from Barcelona,"Hi! 

We will be traveling to Barcelona during the first week of September with our almost 2 year old toddler.  For the 8-days trip we wanted to split our time between Mallorca and Barcelona. Of course, we want to make the trip as hassle free as possible with the baby. 

After brainstorming a bit, we decided to just bite the bullet and fly to Mallorca as soon as we land in BCN, spend a few days there, fly back to BCN to explore the city for a few days and fly back home to NYC.  We figured this would be the most ideal than spending some time in Barcelona, flying to Mallorca, flying back to Barcelona &amp; etc. 

Anyway, now that we have decided this was the best route, I’m wondering about what to do with our luggage.  We will be trying to pack everything as compact as possible, but will still probably have 2 checked bags, stroller, car seat, diaper bag, and 1-2 carry on bag. 

The first option we looked into is packing two checked bags for each destination (one for Mallorca, one for Barcelona) as much as possible and storing our luggage at the airport.  We would still bring one checked bag, a stroller, car seat (we are renting a car), and a diaper bag/personal item on our flight to Mallorca, but load off one checked bag and 1-2 carry ons.

The second option would be to just, again, bite the bullet and bring all our luggage with us to Mallorca since we will be renting a car, but it seems like most airlines charge fees for almost everything you bring on board.  Plus it seems like a hassle to lug everything around with us.

If there are other suggestions for our luggage situation or our itinerary in general, it would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you :)",travel

Spain advice for an old couple,"Hello r/travel! 

Im helping an old couple (65F and 71M) plan their first trip to Europe during October-September. During it, they want to visit Spain for a week, get in a city and visit its surroundings. 

And that brings me to my question: what city would you recommend to go? Barcelona or Madrid were my first guesses, but im open to more suggestions. (Ive heard Sevilla or Santiago De Compostela are amazing too) They prefer to take long walks, visit museums and places of interest, nothing too fancy. 

As far as I have seen, Madrid has el Prado Museum, plenty of historical architecture from different time periods and, as a capital, seems pretty well connected.

Barcelona looks more tourist-y, with beaches, the Sagrada Familia, la Rambla, Gaudi's buildings,etc

Budget shouldn't be much of an issue, but they are rather frugal by just how they've always been. 

Thank you everyone",travel

Possible Mistake Fare booked - tips on getting airline to honor fare?,"Good morning, I am looking to see if any of you have tips on how to proceed in my situation.

Last Tuesday I booked 2 round trip tix via Expedia on American Airlines/Iberian to Paris for $327 a piece. Obviously a great deal. Within an hour American changed one leg of the return flight by 1 hour and raised prices back up to market rates ($1040). American has not issued tickets, nor have they or Expedia cancelled the flight.

I have been on the phone with Expedia 3 times totaling 4 hours of talk time where they have tried to get me to reconfirm the flights at the changed fare, I have not reached out to American yet. Expedia claims they can do this due to a schedule change, however a 3rd level manager confirmed to me that this was because there was a mistake by American in reporting fares to Expedia for sale and they changed the prices before issuing my tix. 

First, have any of you been in a similar situation and gotten the airline/agent to honor the fare? 

If not, do any of you more experienced travelers have any tips on getting some traction on the fare being honored?

Thanks in advance for your help!",travel
Finding a skill-based short job/internship/volunteering gig abroad + traveling,"I enjoy traveling while living in other cities. As I'm potentially heading into a gap year, I'm looking for recommendations/advice on how to make this happen in a constructive way. Looking to travel at a slower pace, picking a city where I could work part time/short weeks and using that as a base to travel, while also getting to work on something that hopefully utilises a different set of skills than my profession (software eng), makes an impact, and broadens my worldview. Sure it sounds cliche, but here I am.
