Italy-Spain Trip Advice,"Hello everyone! My two brothers and I are travelling to Southern Europe in July and I was wondering if anyone had recommendations or advice. We know people in both Milan and Barcelona that we plan on staying with. We plan on visiting places between and somewhat near these cities. 

Here is our plan so far:

7/10-11 Travel from West coast US to Manchester

7/12-13 London area

7/14-16 Arrive in Milan, stay with friend.

7/17-19 Mountains (Italy and Switzerland) 

7/20-21 Rome area

7/22-24 Travel to Barcelona, stay with friend.

7/25-26 Southern France, more of Spain, or Portugal?

7/27 Fly back to Manchester from where ever

7/28 Fly back home with a 4.5 hour layover in Atlanta

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these destinations aren't set in stone. The flights to and from Manchester have already been purchased, but nothing else has been finalized. We do want to do some camping, or at least hiking. Depending on where we decide to go we might rent a car, but may just fly to a couple place instead. Again, haven't decided much yet which is why I'm asking here. 

If any of you have recommendations on places that would be cool to visit or any other random advice it would be much appreciated!",Shoestring

Trip to Sorrento/Massa Lubrense (Travel Question),"Hello everyone! 

My family and I  are traveling to Italy in a few weeks (five of us in total)...this will be my third time in the country, but my parents' first. We could not be more excited! We will be spending 5 days in Rome, then will be taking a series of trains to Sorrento (Rome-Naples-Sorrento).

My question regards traveling back and forth from the Sorrento train station to our Airbnb. We plan on doing a few day trips while we are in Massa Lubrense to Naples/Pompeii/Positano, all starting at the Sorrento train station.

Travel Hacking - Air - Hotel - Cruise Savings Techniques,"# Travel Hacking - Air - Hotel - Cruise Best Savings Techniques

‚Ä¢ Always book at least a month in advance. Longer is better.

‚Ä¢ Always arrive and depart outside of the 9am to 5pm hours.

‚Ä¢ Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the cheapest days to fly. Next best are Thursdays. Avoid flying Saturdays and Sundays if at all possible. Never fly on a Monday or Friday.

‚Ä¢ Avoid flying anywhere near big holidays like Christmas or Thanksgiving (duh).

‚Ä¢ After you buy your ticket, keep checking on that same ticket price with the same airline. If the cost of the ticket goes down, call the airline. They will give you a refund or a voucher.

‚Ä¢ Always check alternate airports at your destination. (But make sure the cost of getting to your hotel from the alternate airport is worth the ticket savings.)

‚Ä¢ Nonstop flights are usually more expensive. Consider a connecting flight instead to save money.

‚Ä¢ Alternate routes on international flights are usually much less expensive (like LA to Shenzhen to Hong Kong instead of LA to Hong Kong)

‚Ä¢ Look on sites like cheaptickets, travelocity, and priceline. Once you find a ticket, go to the airlines actual site and check the price again, often it's cheaper.

‚Ä¢ If you want to rent a car, use established [Rent-A-Car](https://c87.travelpayouts.com/click?shmarker=224540&amp;promo_id=2001&amp;source_type=link&amp;type=click) companies to stay out of troubles.

‚Ä¢ Become a clergyman and show your Clergy Identification Card. You will get huge discounts.

Once you find the ticket online, call the airline and ask them about any Special Discount Programs. If you don‚Äôt get any discounts, then tell them you're there to attend a meeting (like a convention). They will often discount you.

‚Ä¢ Travel agents can often offer better deals than the airlines! Call one once you determine a ticket.

The key question to ask them is: ‚ÄúDo you have any discount tickets to go from x to y?‚Äù

‚Ä¢ The best time book a ticket is around 6pm on a Tuesday, using the time zone where the company is located. This is when they update their new ticket prices.

‚Ä¢ Check [WebFlyer](http://webflyer.com/) for specials before booking your ticket.

‚Ä¢ Purchase international tickets from the country you're going to, not the country you're in. So buy a one-way ticket to Hong Kong from the US, then buy another one-way from HK to the US, but do it from an HK company.

‚Ä¢ ""You can also apply this same concept to international connecting flights. Suppose you‚Äôre in the U.S. and you need to visit Singapore and Korea. You can save up to 75% off your tickets if you purchase your ticket out-of-the-country. Start off by purchasing a roundtrip ticket from U.S. to Singapore. While you are inside Singapore, purchase a roundtrip ticket to Korea. This option is usually much cheaper than purchasing both tickets within the U.S.""

‚Ä¢ Winter is usually the cheapest time to fly internationally.

‚Ä¢ A good place to get international tickets: [JetRadar](http://jetradar.com/?marker=224540)

‚Ä¢ ALWAYS check your flight price ""with a hotel"" or ""with a car"", because often the flight can be CHEAPER by doing this.

‚Ä¢ The earlier in the day you fly, the less likely delays will occur.

‚Ä¢ Install DING for amazing deals on Southwest Airlines flights. Same with Fare Alert. Ding is better though.

‚Ä¢ ""You can secretly find out what kind of offers Priceline has recently accepted? Follow the steps below:

1. Go to Priceline‚Äôs page.
2. Go to [BiddingForTravel](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/biddingfortravel/)
3. Check up on the threads at biddingfortravel for the recently accepted offers for your appropriate state or country to find out what offers have been recently accepted by Priceline.
4. Go back to Priceline and search for your airfare ticket, then submit the lowest offer you can, based on the information you‚Äôve gathered on biddingfortravel""

‚Ä¢ You can instantly rebid on Priceline if your bid is rejecting by changing your criteria, like adding another airport.

‚Ä¢ You can also rebid on a different computer with a different credit card.

‚Ä¢ You can get a 50% discount from a ""bereavement fare"" due to a death in a family if you're flying to attend a funeral.

‚Ä¢ You will usually not get a deal by booking a ticket last minute. That's a myth.

‚Ä¢ Learn the three letter code of the airport you're going to and always check that the code is on the tag they put on your bags when they check them. (If you check any bags)

It's rarely worth it to pay extra for first class if your flight is under 4 hours.

‚Ä¢ If you ever travel from one US city to another US city to catch a flight out of the country, show the agent this, and they will refund your 8 percent federal tax on your ticket!

‚Ä¢ The five airlines with the most frequent fatal accidents over the last 20 years are: Aeroflot (Russia), China Airlines (Taiwan), Turkish Airlines (Turkey), EgyptAir (Egypt), and CAAC (China). These airlines have tried hard to make this information unknown to the public.

‚Ä¢ Getting an international student ID card gives you tons of discounts on all kinds of travel expenses. This is the website: [ISIC](http://www.isic.org/)

‚Ä¢ Purchase a ticket, then use [YAPTA](http://www.yapta.com/). They will send you an email if your ticket becomes less. Then call the airline and complain that you could have gotten the ticket cheaper. And they will refund the difference back to you.

‚Ä¢ When the airline offers you to ticket the next flight because they're over booked, say you're interested but it's not enough. Ask for free trip and/or free first class upgrades and/or 100's in cash. You might get it. The time this usually happens is 8am to 9pm and 5pm to 6pm, and on Sunday nights, and on holidays like Xmas and Thanksgiving.

‚Ä¢ Then when you do this, if you need to stay at a hotel, go to a hotel near the airport, and tell them your flight was canceled. You will get a 50% off the rate! Tell them you want the ""Distressed Passenger Rate"".

‚Ä¢ If going to Japan, buy a bundle of hot import car rims from Japan, and sell back here in the US. You will make $1000s in profit if you do it correctly.

‚Ä¢ Use Yahoo answers to ask ""What is a item in &lt;the country you're going to&gt; that is cheap there but expensive in the US?""

Fly at odd times of the day, ideally late at night or noontime. Avoid flying on mornings or on Saturdays or Sundays

‚Ä¢ Get to your flight early, and ask the attendant if there are any seats in the front not booked by anyone. If they aren't, they will move you.

‚Ä¢ Always try to sit as close to the front of the plane as possible (more comfortable, and you get off first).

‚Ä¢ Generally speaking, the best three places for hotel reservations are cheaptickets.com, travelocity, and priceline.

‚Ä¢ Travelaxe is a fantastic app for getting cheap hotel rooms. Located here:

[http://travelaxe.en.softonic.com/](http://travelaxe.en.softonic.com/)

‚Ä¢ Another great place to get cheap hotel rooms is [Hotel Look](http://search.hotellook.com/?marker=224540&amp;language=en) great deals on lastminute hotel deals.

‚Ä¢ When you check into a hotel, always ask what bonuses you IMMEADATELY get if you join their loyalty upgrade. Often you can get a room upgrade or additional discounts.

‚Ä¢ When you check in, always seriously complain about something about the room. ""Two beds? I wanted a single queen!"" If they make you settle, then say ""Well, if I do that for you, what will you do for me?""

‚Ä¢ When you check in, put a 20 dollar bill under your credit card, make sure the guy can see it, and ask if there are any room upgrades available. If he gives you one, give him the card and the 20. If he doesn't, just give him the card.

‚Ä¢ When booking a cruise, always ask about extra tax charges and if food will be included.

Book the cruise, then check back every few days as if you are booking a new cruise. If the price has gone down, complain, and they will refund you the difference.

‚Ä¢ Unlike with airfare, travel agents can often book a better deal on cruises than you can.",Shoestring

Ukraine and Georgia Solo Travel Ideas,"Decided to go travelling for five weeks (37 days) in June and July on a whim! Decided on Ukraine and Georgia as I am fascinated by the culture, and it's far enough away from the UK to still get relatively cheap flights! Budget for whole trip is ¬£800 (without flights). Looking at ¬£10/day for food. Travelling on overnight trains to save some accommodation money and in Georgia I'll be hitchhiking! If anyone has been, please let me know potential places/things that I may miss out on my itinerary.

* Day 1: Vienna (don't know much about the city to be honest, but wanted to experience a new country before I headed out east! Spending less than 24 hours here before I go to Bratislava.
* Day 2: Bratislava - similar to Vienna, simply going here to experience a new country/city given its' proximity to Vienna.
* Day 3-5: Fly to Lviv from Bratislava. I've already been to Lviv earlier this year and really enjoyed it and there's only a few things I still want to see here. I missed out on the ""flame thrower coffee"" last time I was here, so I'm essentially going for this, and to revisit a few of the other awesome parts of this city (Rynok Square, High Castle Hill). Although, if anyone has any suggestions outside the city but not too far I am open.
* Day 5-9: Overnight train to Odessa. Never been here but always wanted to go as I've heard it's awesome in the summer. Looking to just chill out on the beach here to be honest. Any must-see things here?
* Day 10-12: Train to Chisinau - heard there is not much to do here tourist wise but it's close and I figured, why not? Just a couple of nights here and worst case, get to see another country (countries if you count Transnistria)!
* Day 12-16: Train back to Odessa then on to Kiev. Looking forward to Kiev, been here once for a course but didn't get to see the city. Here I want to go to the outdoor gym on the Hydropark island(?) and Independence Square. I've heard the Chernobyl tour is quite good, but I'm not really interested in that to be honest, and it's slightly out of my budget.
* Day 17-20: Overnight train to Kharkiv. Not really sure about what to see here. Haven't heard much about it but I'm open to suggestions. 
* Day 21-24: Fly to Tbilisi. Spend a couple of nights here before I start my hitchhiking journey to Yerevan. 
* Day 24-26:Yerevan. You can probably see a theme here, not sure why I will go here but I will look at making a day trip to Lake Sevan and explore the city. 
* Day 27 - 30: Yerevan to Kutaisi. Probably a mixture of hitchhiking and public transport along the way. I know Kutaisi is a gateway to a number of attractions especially in the north. Is it worth heading up to Mestia? I've heard it's good and really want to go, but also heard there isn't much accommodation options and can thus get a little pricy.
* Day 30 - 34: Kutaisi to Batumi. Like Odessa, will be spending much of my time by the beach I hope! 
* Day 34-37: Overnight bus to Istanbul. Essentially have 1.5 days in Istanbul. Will look to see Taksim Square, Blue Mosque, and maybe some of the islands? I've heard it's absolutely huge in Istanbul so ideally it would be good if there are one or two sights close to eachother I can see! Then I fly home!

Looking forward to exploring seven countries (hopefully!). At the moment the only things set in stone are the flights and my first night in a hostel. So if you think I should stay longer in one place or shorter in another, I am completely open! Let me know your tips and thoughts. My first time traveling solo and I absolutely can't wait. Also, if anyone has any tips on hitchhiking, I'd appreciate it as I also haven't done that before.

Thanks in advance!

Cheapest working holiday visas (Europe),"Any fellow shoestring lads have knowledge of cheap working holiday visas? Advice on good countries to work in also appreciated! 

Planning on a long overseas trip whilst working here and there. We aren‚Äôt picky on where in Europe (West/Central/East), my partner has a UK passport which I believe means he can work pretty much anywhere in the EU without a visa (if Brexit doesn‚Äôt happen that is). I‚Äôm Australian and whilst I have enough savings to travel for quite a while I‚Äôd like to work as well. 

I‚Äôve tried looking into prices in UK but would rather avoid paying so much in visa related costs. Ireland is my current choice but will still cost $571 AUD.

What‚Äôs the cheapest country for a WH visa? Note it‚Äôd have to either be in an English speaking country or a country that I can work in a tourist hostel/bar with basic French/German (happy to learn basics for another language also).

"Like many who sub here I'm a big fan of travel vlogs on YouTube, finding lots of them to be interesting and inspiring. But I want to have a rant....","Is anyone else heartily sick &amp; tired of the absolute slew of seemingly cloned, homogeneous, single-template travel vlogs we're subjected to trawling through in order to find the odd gem? It just seems these days that 90% of them start with a trite "" Hiiii guys, we've just got to the hotel and we can now tell you we're in Hanoiiiiii/Bankok/Indiaaaaaaa"" Cut to next morning and intersperse giggling nonsense and cringe-inducing displays of a lack of research/knowledge/understanding of either the location or its culture(s) with drone shots and slo-mo sequences of the vlogger, vlogger's girlfriend or local walking through a market set to cheesy ambient house. At this point these polished, semi-pro looking tv programmes are very little to do with the travel and the location and pretty well everything to do with the ego of and the appearance of the vlogger. Which is fine, but just don't pretend to be about to show me the bazaars of Old Delhi or the Pyramids when in reality you're showcasing the clothes you've just bought &amp; how great you look in them. And then endorse the airline/hotel group or shitty tour company that are financing you to pretend you're not in it for money &amp; fame (which ain't coming any time soon with your 620 subscribers Karen) These McVlogs are then usually garnished with a *really* contrived thumbnail and uploaded side by side with a kajillion other identically saccharine 'coupley' clone travel vlogs. And while we're on the subject of thumbnails... I'm not gonna name &amp; shame because I'm just a salty, cynical old bastard having a rant &amp; theyve a perfect right to do wtf they want... But. There's two particular couples who have pretty popular channels &amp; are shoestring(ish) backpacker(ish) youtubers and in the vast majority of their respective thumbnails both women are doing this gimpy, village idiot, *Deliverance*-esque open mouthed grin. Irritates the living shit out of me and I can't work out out which channel's copying which. 

And that, ladies &amp; gentlemen, is what grinds my gears today. 

I should note that this is in no way intended to denigrate the tons of really good vloggers on YouTube who clearly love travelling and really enjoy &amp; do a good job of imparting the feel of where they are. Mostly by keeping the camera pointed at what they're looking at &amp; not crapping on about how great they are. 

This standardisation of many clone vlogs and the message it delivers has become lazy, egotistical &amp; shallow. 

And stop it with the slo mo b-roll, it's nauseatingly boring now.

How do you find things to do in a new city?,"After I've exhausted popular interesting things to do, my next course of action in a new city is either:

- ask locals/friends for things to do, most of whom point me to the same popular things I just got done doing 
- wander around aimlessly for a while, and just looking for things to do. Usually find cool things!

How do you go about having meaningful experiences?



I tried solving this problem by making a website, linked below. The idea is to share these experiences in a private community so others can relive them. But I'm still looking for much better alternatives! I'm not sure something like this is the best solution; I've only been traveling for a few years now.

"Cheap Flights from DC to Athens, Greece?","Guys,

I'm looking for a flight to Greece from the DC area leaving on July 4th or July 10th, and return two weeks later.  So either July 4th - July 18th or July 10th - July 24th.  I do not want a layover longer than 4 hours either way.  

I'm using Hopper alerts and Google Flights alerts.  Before I book I will check Momondo and Skyscanner too to make sure I'm getting the best rate possible.

The Hopper app is telling me the rates right now are good and I should book now @ $1,150/roundtrip each ticket.  I know people that booked 4 months ago for $750/roundtrip each for the same dates.  I really want to do this trip for $1k/roundtrip each ticket.  Two adults and one child less than 2 (lap).

Is it worth waiting it out? Or should I book now? I'm patient enough that I don't mind waiting a month or two for better rates.

Advice for 12 days in Italy,"My boyfriend and I (early 20s) will be in Italy for 12 days this summer (8 days in Rome and 4 days in Naples, not including travel days) and I'm looking for some ideas for what to do while we're there. For 6 of the days we are in Rome I will be attending a conference so I will only get to explore the city in the evening/night on most days. Cost is also a big concern for me because the conference registration alone was crazy expensive, not to mention the flight/airbnb/etc. Does anybody have any ideas for things we could do later in the evening that don't cost much?

While we are in Naples, I think it would be fun to take a day trip to another city/area since we will be surrounded by so many beautiful locations. I definitely want to go to Pompeii, but I'm also looking into Sorrento, Amalfi, or Capri. Any thoughts on how doable this is while only have 4 days in Naples?

Honestly the more I plan this trip the closer I get to just throwing caution to the wind and spending all of my savings... Help me not do that please lol

Let alone being out in the woods alone, I am considering the possibilities of somebody finding out im on the road and robbing me or worse? Small handgun would probably be preferred but hypothetically speaking sure yeah whatever maybe a bow and arrow or crossbow? 

4. For those who have settled(even if only for a short period of time) what tips and advice can you pass along about finding a suitible town/job. What is the best way to go about transitioning to stable living space/electricity/running water

5. What about staying connected via mobile phone? I thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and pay my phone bill a few months in advance. I am hoping Metro PCS works well nationwide.

6. Does anyone have experience living out of their car? Any advice or recommendation regarding such would just be icing on the cake!

Short trip to Washington,"Hi, I'm planning a short trip to **Washington**. We are 2 people (25 yeas old) and we want to stay there just for a weekend or maybe some extra day, maximum 3-4 days, in **early June**. We will probably fly to Baltimore airport, which offers the cheapest flights, and we will move around the city by public transportation.

* Do you know any cheap accommodation?
* Any advice on what to visit in such a short time? Indispensable activities/places? Places that need to be booked? Non-essential places or tourist traps?
* Any advice on food, transportation, or where to have a drink?
* How much time would you spend visiting the National Mall museums?
* Other parts of the city you would reccomend visiting appart from the National Mall?

**Any advice in general is much appreciated.**

8 days not including travel days. Ferry arrives in Heraklion and flight leaves there too. I've heard good things about Chania and it seems like a good place to wander. The only thing I can think of that attracts me Heraklion are the Minoan ruins which I do want to see. 

Current plan is to land in Heraklion spend the night (late ferry) then go to Chania the next day. 3 days Chania &gt; travel day to Heraklion &gt; 3 days Heraklion &gt; travel day airport.

I'm a college student living in Boise and just wrapped up on a super stressful week. I really want to get out of this town and to somewhere big and boisterous.

I'm willing to drive and am considering driving to Seattle or Portland Thursday night, spend Friday and Saturday there, then drive back Sunday, in which case the expenses to take into account would be gas, lodging, and pocket money. I'm looking at a $200 budget for everything excluding gas. Anyone have ideas on how to pull this off?

A realistic budget for a 1-2 week vacation to Japan?,"My fiancee and I (USA) are planning on 1-2 weeks in Japan in June of next year for a honeymoon trip. We're making a big move for work a year later, so we really want to have this vacation now and make it count since we don't see ourselves being able to make a trip to Japan soon after our move. 

Because of the upcoming move and wedding, we do want to budget the trip. The tickets are about $750-800 each to Osaka where we're at, which is a big expense, and we are willing to sacrifice some budget to get Airbnb rather than hostel living. And then there's the rail pass I've read about as well.

That way I can meet up with different groups when I feel like it depending on what they're up to.

Then I was thinking about what else I could do with that money instead. I'm not really sure if Festivals like that are my scene, a lot of the talks are blatantly anti-science and I just can't put up with people like that (chakras, energy healing, ""cleanses"", star numbers or whatever, etc. I honestly can't believe how many people still believe in that crap, but I digress...). 

Instead, I've thought of a few options:

* going surfing in Hawaii or Costa Rica for the week.

* Buying kitesurfing gear and getting lessons somewhere (like Florida) because that's a hobby that I can get into and use for years.

* Spend a weekend in NYC meeting up with friends

missing a connection - not an accident,"I am planning to fly one way from ORD-&gt;BRU this summer. When I looked at direct flights they were coming in at over $800. HOWEVER, that same flight with the same airline was only $250 total if I were to book the flight as ORD-&gt;BRU-&gt;LHR. Therefore, I could save over $500 by just missing the last portion of the flight. I won't have any checked bags and will not be flying back with that airline.

I have heard of the whole ""hidden city ticketing"" before. I've never done it and do not plan to do it much, if ever again. That amount of money would be substantial for me to save. That being said, should i be worried about ramifications of missing the connection? Will I run into troubles at customs in Belgium as I am exiting the airport or planning to leave the country?

Deciding to Travel and my Questions,"Hey Guys, I'm Rhys and I'm an 18 y/o student living in the UK. My A-Level Exams are 45 Days away and I'm really starting to think about what I want to do after. I've been stuck in education system up until this point with Uni applications and everything and it has only just occurred to me that now is the first time in my life I could truly go traveling. 
What do you think about traveling before University? Is it a good idea or is it better to wait until after? Ideally I'd like to do it before, during and after. 
I'm also trying to decide whether to go it alone or try and bring a friend. I like the idea of travelling with someone, but I doubt this would be a possibility within my current friendship group. A lot of them think it is a waste of time, which is the polar opposite to how I feel. 
I'd really like to go to South East Asia. Places like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and anywhere else. Any suggestions on other areas in the region? 
I'm also trying to get into photography so I can take all the awesome pictures and maybe start up a travel Instagram or maybe even Vlog the trip on travel YouTube channel?

cool to know Hydra can be a day trip from Athens! I also plan on going to Delphi as a day trip with Athens as home base.

At the moment I'm thinking 5 nights Athens&gt; 2 days island A &gt; 2 days island B (or chania) &gt; 3 days Heraklion, leave on 4th day for London.  

some of the smaller islands like Patmos look interesting but I was having a hard time finding cheap hostels.

I've been doing planning and taxes all day so I'm going to try and take a break until tomorrow.


EDIT 2: Can I get to Pireas port before 7am on a Friday or Saturday via metro or bus? I'm having difficulty finding time tables for that info.

Best Way to Plan a Trip?? What's your method?,"My trip planning starts with Scott's cheap flights when they send me an email about a deal. Then, I find if the deal is available on Google flights for my city and buy the ticket if it aligns with my work schedule. Here is where the real planning starts...

I'll generate a new Google Sheet doc to collect all the info and create a rough itinerary (each column is a day of the trip and I'll write down important events like flights and checkin locations and things to do, places to eat, etc).

This works because I've been going on 8-9 day trips lately so the itinerary doesn't get too big. I'll first check for hostels or Airbnbs and if the price is right, I'll book it and then put it in the google doc. Then, I'll look for things to do on reddit, blogs, TripAdvisor, etc. If they need booking, I'll book them. I might ask for recommendations from friends as well if they've previously been to the location.

After I have an idea of what I want to do, I'll try to find some info on how to get to certain places usually from various blogs and sometimes from TripAdvisor and reddit and I'll either link them in the Google doc or jot it down as a note.

I'll estimate the cost or write down what I‚Äôm willing to spend and total everything up with all the known costs and that'll give me my total budget (roughly).

I might check the weather so that I can pack accordingly and check for the currency info as well.

I'll probably forget to check if I need a visa until I'm at the airport lol but this hasn't bit me yet.

I‚Äôll centralize all the info I collected into the Google sheet itinerary which ends up being pretty useful on the trip and after the trip as well just to tally everything up.

Just wanted to share that and was wondering what your guys method was to plan a trip?? Are there any things you do differently? The same? Any apps to help me be more efficient? Planning takes such a long time and even though I'll be excited for the trip, I‚Äôm sometimes not excited to plan it! Thanks.",Shoestring

Singapore of a shoestring,"Some older posts had links to blogs, but I thought I‚Äôd start a thread with some collective wisdom on enjoying this awesome city without going broke. 

ACCOMODATIONS: I found hostels on Agoba and also Booking.com. In the end I picked based on proximity to a subway line (Oh, how I love Singapore‚Äôs subway!!) but here are 3 spots friends or I enjoyed for less than $20/night. Look for places with breakfast (toast, coffee, tea). Also, it seemed that booking online actually got you a lower rate than booking extra nights at the front desk, FYI.

*Happy Snail Hostel* fun place to meet other solo travelers. 

*Vintage Inn Boutique Capsule Little India* was very affordable and very near the subway. Had laundry onsite and quiet location. No hot water, fyi. 

*Bunc Hostel* great vibe and lots of diverse travelers, as well as 24-hour reception (good for late arrivals/early departures) and good, budget travel ideas.

TRANSPORTATION: get an MRT card when you first arrive and enjoy what is possibly the best-smalled and most well-signaged train system in the world. Holy heck, do they make it easy!

Also Grab app for cabs is great for getting to the airport or the few places public transit doesn‚Äôt reach. 

TO DO FOR FREE:
Taken straight from Bunc hostel‚Äôs wall of suggestions:


1. Visit the Merlion 

2. East Coast Park. Water activities available, eat yummy local food at Lagoon Food Center.

3. Temple Hopping: Chinatown-Buddha Tooth Relic and Sri Moriommom (sp?); Kampong Glam-Sultan Mosque; Little India-Sri Veeramakaliamman. DRESS APPROPRIATELY, cover your knees and shoulders. 

4. Tree top walk: MacRitchie Reservoir Park-climb above the raiforest canopy in this park in the middle of the city.

5. Singapore River: walk 3.2 km from Raffles Place up to Clarke Quay (or the other direction) from shophouses to skyscrapers.  

TO DO FOR NOT TOO MUCH: 
Top of the *Marina Bay Sands*: buy a $22 food/beverage voucher to Ce La Vi restaurant on tower 3 and look out the Sky Observation Deck at the top (the deck pass is $23 and does not include food). 

*Gardens by the Bay*-if you skip the suspended walkway, you still see amazing gardens. 

*Botanic Gardens*: also lovely, although 

*Fort Canning* is similarly educational for free. 

*Cable Cars* vs. *Singapore Flyer*. Being able to explore Sentosa Island beaches and get to see the city from above might make the cable cars a better choice for you than the Singapore Flyer. A ticket for all three sections of cable car was $35 as of March, 2019). 

EATING: Hawker Centers are awesome. Shopping malls are often cheap and yummy, too. Maybe others can chime in below with favorites? Note: bring your own napkins!

"If you have access to a kitchen, here's a 7-day meal plan that's extra budget-friendly ($5/day)","I wrote this initially to share on my Twitter for any of my followers interested, but I feel like it also fits well here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Healthy Dishes for $5 a Day, With Tex-Mex Dinners**

$5 a day is only $35 a week. Is it possible?

If you‚Äôre starting with an empty pantry, then purchasing all of the items may come over $35. That‚Äôs okay. Some of the ingredients will last longer than this weeks meals. However, each days meals will not exceed the $5 budget.

And it can be even less than that if you utilize smart shopping techniques. You know, like buying in bulk and taking advantage of deals.

**Grocery List**

* 450g chicken
* 500g ground beef
* 150g canned tuna
* 150g lentils
* 3 bell peppers (2 can be substituted, options within recipe)
* 2 cans black beans (cut the price by soaking dry beans)
* 2 cans crushed tomatoes
* 1 head of lettuce (or other leafy green)
* 1 cucumber
* 2 avocados
* 3 large white onions (or yellow)
* 2 carrots
* 6 tortillas
* 1 jar of salsa
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 chicken boullion cube
* 350g oatmeal
* 4 bananas
* 12 eggs
* 60g rice

Seasonings and condiments aren‚Äôt listed, as most people have the basics on hand.

Also, I know avocado may not be the most affordable if you live in northern countries. None of these meals will be based solely around avocado, so you can easily substitute it for mashed peas or omit it.

**Breakfast (all 7 days)**

Banana Cinnamon Oatmeal

This is going to be the most boring part of the day, but hey, we‚Äôre on a budget! Go ahead and cook all your oatmeal, with two bananas sliced into smaller pieces. Add cinnamon and sugar to your liking. You can then split this into 7 portions, throw them in the freezer, and you‚Äôre done! All you have to do is microwave each one for about 1-2 minutes each morning.

**Lunch (days 1-4)**

Lentil Soup

To make this soup, first dice up an onion, 1 garlic clove, and 2 carrots. In a large saucepan, add a little oil and cook these veggies until soft. Pour in 3 cups (700mL) of water and 150g of lentils, and let this simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes. Next, add the bouillon cube and stir until it dissolves. Then, add 1 can of crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. I like thyme and basil! Let this mixture simmer for about another 10 minutes.

Divvy this up into four meals, and then you have an easy lunch to grab over the next few days. You can also pair this with a baguette for an extra delight.

**Lunch (days 4-7)**

Tuna Salad

First off, if you are not a fan of tuna, you can swap this for chicken! Now that your protein is decided, go ahead and hard-boil 2 eggs. When that‚Äôs done, peel and dice the eggs. In a large bowl, add 150g of tuna, very small diced pieces of 1 bell pepper, and the diced eggs. The bell pepper can also be switched for celery - maybe it‚Äôs cheaper. Mix it all up with a couple tablespoons of mustard (my preference, you can choose mayo instead) and add salt and pepper to your liking.

Add this mixture on top of a bed of lettuce, cucumber slices, or bread for a quick protein-packed lunch.

**Dinner (days 1-3)**

Chicken Tacos

Each dinner will need 150g of chicken, 1/3 a can of black beans, handful of diced cucumber, 1/3 of an onion, half an avocado (or peas), lettuce, salsa, and 2 tortillas.

Dice the chicken and cook it over medium-high heat with onions (either diced or in strips). Add salt and pepper. If you have chili powder, cumin, paprika, and/or garlic powder, add those too!

While this is cooking, you can rinse the black beans and heat them (microwave or on the stove). Also, take this time to chop some lettuce and mash the avocado. Spice up the avocado by adding some seasonings, if you‚Äôd like.

When the chicken is finished cooking, transfer it to a bowl, wipe the pan clean, and heat the tortillas (about 30 seconds on each side).

Finally, assemble your tacos with all the ingredients, with choosing to either eat the beans on the side or in the taco.

**Dinner (day 4)**

Stuffed Bell Peppers

You will need 100g of ground beef, 1/3 a can of black beans, 100g of salsa, 1 bell pepper (you can substitute this for eggplant, zucchini, etc.), 60g of rice, and half an avocado.

Start with cutting the bell pepper in half, coring out the seeds, and then baking it at 180 celsius (350 fahrenheit) for about 10 minutes.

While this is baking, get started on cooking the rice. Simply add your rice and double the water to a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once it‚Äôs at a boil, bring the temperature down to low and allow it to cook until all the water is absorbed. Then, remove from the heat.

While the rice is cooking, in a pan over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef. Season it how you‚Äôd like, but I recommend salt, pepper, chili powder, and cumin. Once the meat is cooked through, add rinsed black beans, salsa, and the rice (unless you want to eat it on the side).

Take the bell peppers out of the oven, and stuff each side with the meat mixture. Continue baking this until the peppers are soft.

Serve with mashed avocado on top and rice on the side, if you omitted it from the mixture.

**Dinner (days 5-7)**

Chunky Chili

Chili was actually my first ‚Äòadult‚Äô meal I ever learned to cook because it was so simple, yet packed with so much flavor. All you have to do is brown 400g of ground beef over medium-heat, then in a large saucepan combine the meat and all of the other ingredients. This includes 1 diced onion, 1 diced bell pepper, 2/3 of a can of black beans (drained), 1 can crushed tomatoes, and 1 clove minced garlic. To that mixture, add salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings. A true pot of chili contains chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, and cayenne pepper.

In addition to that, I personally would add Tabasco sauce for an extra kick and some cinnamon.

Mix it up real good, let it boil for a couple minutes, then simmer it on low for about 30 minutes to get all the flavors out. Serve this as-is, or if your budget allows, some grated cheese and crackers.

**Snacks**

What‚Äôs leftover from the grocery list is 2 bananas and 10 eggs. That‚Äôs enough for 7 days. 1 banana or 2 eggs is a nice little snack to eat whenever you need. I like to eat a banana or hard-boiled eggs a couple hours after dinner.

If you do follow this meal plan, or even try one recipe from it, please let me know your thoughts! And if this is something you want to receive every week, I'm still toying with the idea of creating more based around spending $5 a day - if I notice lots of people are interested, I for sure will create many more. [Let me know if you're interested here](https://www.budgetmealplanner.com/). Was even thinking of some extreme ones like a 7-day meal plan based around only having a water boiler!

When I asked for a price breakdown or where these fees were coming from, the supervisor just responded ""They are taxes"". When I asked who was taxing me, since taxes were already accounted for, she changed it to ""Spirit charges an in-person booking fee""

So does spirit now have a new in-person booking fee? What's the deal?

Edit: After talking to Spirit on the phone and making a small fuss, I was able to get them to show me a breakdown of the price on there system.

"When backpacking, do you begin with the most expensive areas or least expensive areas?","I am planning a backpacking trip to Europe for 2-4 months (as long as possible with the budget I will have!), starting sometime between October and February (some tips on weather in these areas would help, I've been to Prague in February and it was fine, but Cesky Krumlov was pretty chilly, had to layer 2 jackets, where I only had to wear one in Prague. Packing-wise, I would prefer to bring one jacket and under layers.). I'll be going to Eastern and Central Europe. I have a while to iron out the details, but I am beginning to plan things out now. I am interested in these places (no particular order): Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Moldova (?), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Austria, Poland, Germany, and Slovakia.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to look into workaways in Czech Republic, and maybe Hungary, for 1-2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I also want to go to Ireland and stay a few weeks at a workaway and travel around the country a bit, and possibly Scotland as well. I'm Canadian but my ancestors are from Ireland, so I know it doesn't make sense with the rest of the trip, but it's something I really want to include. I think this will be the most expensive part of the trip- so should I go to Ireland/Scotland first and then make do with the rest of my money in the cheaper areas, or should I do Eastern/Central Europe first and then go to Ireland/Scotland and stay as long as possible before flying home?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll definitely look into flights and see what makes sense cost-wise (probably Northern Europe because it's closer), but what have your experiences been with this? I don't want to feel like I can't spend anything in Northern Europe because I'm saving for this long trip I have ahead. Advice on this?

How safe is messaging system with couchsurfing? Host being flaky and risks of retaliation,"Hey fellas, i regurlarly ghostfag travel reddits and aware of the current topics and came across a comparable situation.

To make things short: i am male with a couple positive references, and i requested a female member (non membership paid) with 10+ references(all as a guest, 0 as a host) and she previously received a negative reference for flaking a host without updating. Her couch availability was set in green as ""definitely host""

While she confirmed hosting me and i made things necessary to communicate, i never heard of her despite a couple of nice short reminders, and seen she logged into her account daily.

I canceled my request a day before the hosting date mentioning i never heard of any update, no set meeting nor contact number from her.

Funny part: I contacted the Safety team because of some dodgy details in her profile: she has set her privacy account settings to ""display first name only"" and her account name is a fictional music character with that first name. Her displayed age is 19yo yet she suscribed in 2013 and got references from all these previous years (i made my request assuming from such deduction i wont have to deal with potentially underaged peeps)

Safety team just said they followed up in accordance of terms and conditions, yet i dont see her account being frozen till details are updated. The age remains 19 and name the same. But now her couch status is in a red ""not hosting""

REALLY missed the budget last weekend in Chicago...,"My partner and I drove to see a concert (Haywyre) in Chicago last Friday and tried really hard to low-ball our spending. I searched endlessly for a cheap place to stay and I initially thought to stay near the city and take the train, but the cheapest Airbnb's were all over $80 and train fare would've put us over $100 per day. We ended up finding a hotel near O'Hare for $55/night and driving into the city. Big mistake!!! We ran into every toll road, ended up wasting hours in downtown traffic (we forgot all about the Chi town festivities for St. Patty's Day...), and I got fed up driving in circles around drunk people that I accidentally pulled into a parking garage that cost $20/hour! We eventually left downtown to explore China Town and walked into a BBQ restaurant that ended up costing $70 before tip because we didn't check the menu til we already sat down...

New Zealand in October/November for 1 month (Backpacking),"Hi all,

The SO and I are currently in the midst of planning our backpacking trip.

We will be flying from Taipei into Auckland (hopefully) on the 13th of October and staying for a month.

As we are a couple we would prefer private rooms as opposed to mixed dorms as that is the plan for SE Asia.

However, I keep seeing mixed reports on how expensive 1 month will be. Do you have tips on keeping the costs down?

We are unsure weather to go with a buss pass (kiwi exp or something similar) or just use inter city buses to get around.

Ideally we would love to hire a camper but that will just be too expensive.

Our budget is around $13,500.00 each but that's including all of SE Asia and $5000.00 will be needed to get into Aus with our working visa

12 Days in Philippines. 5 Must-Do's?,"Hey Frans,

My girlfriend and I have 12 non-flight/travel days in the Philippines March 23rd-April 6. We fly into and out of Cebu. My feeling is with such limited time, we should stick to 5 or 6 places max.

We're somewhat flexible with our budget, not at all opposed to staying in hostels majority of the trip, but would absolutely love a day or 2 of pampering in a resort, or somewhere we can lay in beach loungers with pina coladas without tons of people. The rest of the time, **we'd like to be diving or doing anything outdoors and adventurous. Would love to stay away from super touristy sites/towns**, but realize it's going to take longer to get to more remote places, and we have limited time.

**What are 5 must see places or must do's while in the Philippines for 12 days? We fly into and out of Cebu, so any itinerary suggestions that start and end in Cebu would be much appreciated!**

Thank You!!

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who gave us suggestions! The trip was a success! Time to return the favor for anyone that hasn't been yet. Here are some trip notes for the places we went within the Philippines:

Philippines Cebu ‚Ä¢Boljoon ‚Ä¢Hostel: Noordzee - stay in the beach tent. It is more like an A-frame cabin. They have bomb food both American and Filipino. Recommend mango shakes and fresh fruit mojitos. Seaside massages in their ‚Äúspa‚Äù that is more like two rooms overlooking the ocean. Beach bar and hammocks. Great staff and friendly guests when we‚Äôre there. Be careful of belongings because anyone can walk through the beach and a couple of people had belongings stolen in lockers.

‚Ä¢Activities: you can see the whale sharks in Oslob but we didn‚Äôt do it because they feed them year long to keep them there for tourists. We did the Canyoneering instead and had a phenomenal guide named Wilson. If you book through Noordzee then you will get paired with Roy‚Äôs company where Wilson works. Transportation and guides will be set up by the front desk.

‚Ä¢Moalboal ‚Ä¢Notes: was really not feeling this place because it was super busy and people were a little more aggressive with trying to give you rides and sell you things. We ended up staying one day only. ‚Ä¢ Hostel: Chief Mao - ended up not staying here but they have a lot of hammocks, good food, centrally locates ‚Ä¢Activities: Sardine Run can dive or snorkel. This was actually really dope. It's spectacular to be diving and in the MIDDLE of 7 million Sardines, not just seeing from above. Definitely dive it if you have your certification. It's only $20 to dive.

‚Ä¢Mactan/Cebu City- ended up staying at the Waterfront Hotel in Mactan for three nights (not consecutively). It is right across from the airport (walk) and they have a great breakfast buffet. It's a bit pricey so negotiate, but it's an extremely convenient location.

‚Ä¢Busuanga Island/Coron Town

‚Ä¢Hotel: Charms Hotel - decent breakfast. Great pool and air conditioned rooms. Hot water isn‚Äôt great for showers. 15 minute walk from center of the town. Maybe would have enjoyed Hotel Del Mar more, but they had limited availability when we were there.

‚Ä¢Activities: ‚Ä¢WW2 Ship Wreck Diving. Recommend diving with Amphibi-Ko

‚Ä¢Island Hopping tour Or Coron Island Tour. There are several tour groups that will take you. We used Laugh Trip and Millennial. For the price, these are definitely worth the while. You can go private, but unless you have like 7 friends, it's crazy expensive.

‚Ä¢Rent a Scooter for the day and drive around the island. This was one of my favorite days. So so nice to get some fresh air, away from all the hustle and bustle, and get to see the lush countryside. We got our scooter for like $20 for 12 hours. We used Angel Motorcycle Rental. We were very happy with them. The other places had terrible reviews.

Several people said the El Nido tours were worthwhile but we didn't have time.
