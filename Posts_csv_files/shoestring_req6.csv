Guatemala Questions and Itinerary,"Got a flight deal that was too good to pass up. I’ll be there for a week. 

I get to Guate City, then from the airport I’ll get an Uber to Antigua and stay for a couple days. What is the shortest/fastest volcano I can hike? I don’t want to do a multi-night hike if possible.

From there I’ll go to Lake Atitlan and spend a couple days.

From there I’ll take a sleeper train to Tikal. I’ll spend a couple days there and return to Guate City to leave.

Does this itinerary make sense or am I out of order with my cities? 

Any other suggestions on what to do while there?",Shoestring
Carry on baggage question,"Hello.

My friend and I are planning on doing a 2 week trip to Austria. We have a budget and when looking at flights, checking in baggage is too expensive (like $160 roundtrip each). We planned on just checking one bag, but now we just rather take a backpack and a carry on each.

Carry on limits, according to the website I am getting tickets from ([Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com), which gets info from the airlines, I believe), is 7 kg. The return trip is 8 kg.

I just packed my carry-on bag as if I were traveling tomorrow (without packing toiletry bag, a sweater, and little misc items like belts) and the bag weighed 7.5 kg already. We want to have our backpacks as empty as possible to pack the items we buy during the trip.

Supposing the carry on bags weigh 9 kg or 10 kg when traveling, is this going to be a big deal? How strict are airlines with this? Do they weigh the bag?

I imagine low-cost airlines may be more strict... does anyone has experience with Norweigan, XL France, Laudamotion, EuroWings, Austrian Air? Those are airlines serving the flights we are looking at.

We just want to save money and have enough for the actual trip, and I can't believe that 2 kg or 3 kg would be a reason to make us check a small bag. Also, I have had check-in people not weigh my carry-on bag before, and when they do, I have had them not care about an excess of a kilogram or two. Should I expect the same from the airlines I mentioned?

How to do Latin America in 6 months? Advice por favor...,"So, I've decided to leave the USA and go on an adventure starting in about month.

Looking for advice for where/what to do for about 6 months...

&amp;#x200B;

A couple things about me:

1) 31M USA

2) Speak decent level of spanish

3) Got a solid savings, but I'd prefer to keep monthly spending to around $2000 USD. 

4) Pretty open-minded. Also, in good physical condition so I'm open to outdoor stuff. 

5) I love making music and films. So I will want to bring my equipment, at least, my camera, gimbal and lenses. Trying to make a decision on baggage. 

6) Enjoy walking outside, eating street food, taking a beer/coffee. 

7) Open to staying in places for extensive periods of time. 

8) I've been in Mexico and Costa Rica recently and loved it. Although, I'd prefer to explore further south (Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Argentina...)

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a realllyyyy open-ended question. Guess that's the point. But, if you had to recommend some places I absolutely must-see or at least stay for a few weeks. It would be a pleasure to hear what you've got. :)

2 months in South East Asia/China for £1800 - advice needed.,"Hey guys, I posted something here a few days ago and got some really helpful responses so I thought I'd ask for some more advice:

I've (22M) decided to go to South East Asia (Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam) and China, leaving next month. My budget is \~£1800 for everything and I'm based in UK. Ideally I'd like to spend 1 month in SEA and then 3 weeks to a month in China.  I was planning on starting at Bangkok, then making my way through Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh, HCM city, Hanoi, then across the Chinese coast up to Shenzhen.

I hear SEA (especially Vietnam and Cambodia) is very doable money-wise but I hear different things about China so if anyone has some experience and could comment on how feasible this budget is/suggest some changes I'd appreciate it. 

Also, what are some cool landmarks/places between Hanoi and Shenzhen that you would suggest?

Thank You!",Shoestring

U.S fall vacation ideas?,"I'm hoping to take a fall (Sept-Oct) vacation with my wife later this year, but I'm not sure where to go. We are pretty flexible with the type of vacation. Big city, camping, beaches, mountains, we don't really care.  I want to stay in the US to keep the price down.

Anyone had good experiences lately? Small (cheap) U.S. towns worth going to? Good Air BnBs or places to stay? I want to keep the trip as well below $800 as possible, and thats including room, food, tickets, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Part of the reason for this post, other than I would like to take a vacation, is because I've noticed that the U.S. isn't getting much love in this sub! Sure, its never going to be as cheap as east Asia. But there are lots of deals to be found in America and ways to vacation on a shoes string budget, I think we just need to find them",Shoestring

Where to spend 5 or 6 nights in Greece in October?,"Hi guys! My partner and are planning to spend roughly a week on a Greek island in early October.

Chasing Peru's Priceless Golden Fleece,"I've spent the past 25 years traveling alone to remote cultures and filming PBS/National Geographic documentary series. I live with the locals and often hitchhike; on average I spent about $1000 per month. I’m posting excerpts from all of these docs to a YouTube channel called [Our Human Planet.](https://www.youtube.com/OurHumanPlanet) Every story was essentially free to do, from cricket fighting China to rebels in Sudan.

Peru (+Bolivia? Colombia?),"I tend to plan very ambitious itineraries for my trips and this time I could use some advice. I’m 1/2 Peruvian and have never been, so my family is going in January for a week. I’ve decided to go a week ahead of them, but I’m not sure how to spend the first week.

My initial thought was to travel to Bolivia to see an old friend and visit the Uyuni salt flats. Then I thought maybe Medellin because I’m also 1/2 Colombian and I’ve heard that New Years there is amazing — though, I don’t know anyone there. (I’ve already been to other Colombian cities, but never Medellin.) My third thought is that I should just take it easy and spend the full two weeks in Peru getting to know family and exploring more of the country.

The price difference isn’t huge for a multi-destination ticket and I have such little vacation time in a year that I tend to tack on as many destinations as possible, but maybe it’d be better to just do one?

Advice from experienced travelers would be greatly appreciated!",Shoestring
Is it tacky or inappropriate to fill up a flask from the free-flowing coffee station in a restaurant?,"When we first traveled together, SO &amp; I easily spent 20e on our first day on coffee (expensive European city, horrible coffee, but coffee is life, so..). I think it's a huge waste of resources so the next few days, I suggested to just share a cup each time throughout each day. Worked out well enough, still an expense that I think we can cut down further on.

We will be traveling together again in a few weeks. We're working on a budget now and he put in 30e for coffee for three days! Que horror! Lol! I suggested that maybe we can bring a flask instead and fill it with coffee from the coffee station during the free breakfast provided by the hotel. He was aghast, to say the least. He said that it's inappropriate and that he'd walk out if I did that. He also said that people will stare and the staff may not say anything but they will certainly talk about me.

I'm just meh about it because for me it boils down to saving some that can be better spent on other things. And I rationalized it as, it's free-flowing, drink all you can anyways, so what difference does it make if you drink it there or take it with you?

Anyways.. Just wanted to ask fellow travelers' opinions.. Am I on the wrong here? Is it tacky or inappropriate?",Shoestring
Where would you go on a free trip to anywhere?,"This is my second post here. You guys were so helpful the first time around that I’m coming back to you for advice.

In addition to my full-time job, I work part time as a tutor. Recently, my student’s parents offered me a plane ticket to anywhere as a thank you gift. They know I love traveling. I was pretty overwhelmed by the offer. The only constraints are that it has to be accessible by American Airlines or a partner because they’re buying the ticket with miles.

We took a two-week honeymoon in Europe for $3600. Here's our budget!,"My hubby and I recently tied the knot. We're recent college grads and don't have much savings yet, so we decided to forgo a traditional wedding in favor of eloping and going on a nice honeymoon together. We managed to keep everything under $4000 USD without sacrificing our overall enjoyment of the vacation. Here's an overview of the trip:

* Origin: United States (east coat)
* Glasgow, Scotland (4 days)
* Edinburgh, Scotland (4 days)
* Dublin, Ireland (5 days)
* Reykjavik, Iceland (3 days)

And here is a breakdown of our spending over the course of 16 days (rounded for easier math):

* **Accomodations: $850.** We stayed  in AirBnB's. In most cases we had a private room with shared kitchen/living area, and in Iceland we had our own ""tiny home.""
* **Airfare: $870.** Our long-haul flights were $790 (Icelandair with a free 3-day stopover) and we also took an $80 Ryanair flight to Dublin. What really kept our cost down was not having any checked bags. We brought 40L backpacks as our carry-ons.
* **Local transport: $670.** This includes Ubers to our airport and back (cheaper than parking fees), local buses, trains for day trips and to get to Edinburgh, and our rental car in Iceland (plus insurance/gas/parking). We also took a couple of Ubers to make it easier to find our AirBnBs from the airport.
* **Food: $900.** We averaged around $55 per day. We typically just ate out one meal per day (usually lunch) and cooked everything else in our AirBnB. We both don't like to drink a lot of alcohol, so that definitely helped to keep the cost down.
* **Attractions: $240.** Personally we like to to spend most of our time exploring nature and checking out historical sites, so we avoided a lot of the pricey touristy stuff. Of course there were a few must-see sights that we paid to go to, including Edinburgh Castle, the Guiness Brewery, the Irish Whiskey Museum, and Iceland's Secret Lagoon. This also includes tips for a few free walking tours that we went on.
* **International medical insurance: $50**. Just a basic package.

**That brings our total cost to roughly $3600**. We're very happy to have come out under budget, especially when we really did not feel like we were skimping. It was definitely not a ""luxurious"" vacation but we had a ton of fun and made some lifelong memories. I'll summarize by just giving a few tips to help others save some money on their travels.

* Be flexible with your destination. We knew we wanted to fly to Europe with Icelandair to take advantage of their free stopover, but we weren't committed to a specific destination in Europe. We researched which cities were cheapest to fly into and out of, and kept our eyes peeled for good deals.
* Skip the international phone plans. We just used wifi and were completely fine. Pro tip: you can use location services without any data!
* Don't eat out too much. While food is an important part of travel, we didn't mind cooking a lot of our meals. It saved us a lot of money and also is something we enjoy doing to wind down at the end of the day.
* Take advantage of free attractions, like walking tours, hikes, museusm, etc.",Shoestring

Looking into booking México City for 5 days during Labor Day,"Hey y’all! I’m looking into a 5 day trip to Mexico City for Labor Day. We have only been to the beach towns in Mexico so I’m going to need to some recommendations on this one!

What are some of the best areas to stay in? We are looking to hit up a lot of the historical sites the city has to offer and just wander around aimlessly. Are there certain areas we should avoid? 

We will be taking a day trip to Teotihuacan and want to know the best way out there. Would a day tour be good for this or would you recommend renting a car? We certainly don’t want to be rushed while we are here but I’m not so keen on renting a car. Is there public transportation that will take us to and from there so we don’t have a time restraint? 

What are the prices for food and beer in the city? We aren’t looking for fancy restaurants besides maybe a nice dinner one night. We are not looking for Americanized restaurants and we both thoroughly enjoy authentic Mexican food. 

Any other helpful ideas are always more than welcome too! 

Thanks everyone!",Shoestring
Could I realistically go to Canada/US on this budget?,"I'm based in the UK and have about £1700 saved up. 1900 stretching it. I have never really travelled anywhere before so I'm kind of clueless. I always wanted to see the east coast of the US or Toronto and a bit of Canada (have not decided yet). The flight prices seem pretty brutal though so any advice really would be welcomed.
