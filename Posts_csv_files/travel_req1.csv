r/travel Region of the Week: 'Wallonia',"Hey travellers!
 
In this new series of weekly threads we want to focus on regions that have a lot to offer to travellers: the towns, nature, and other interesting places whether they are lesser or more known. If more known provide more in depth suggestions like tours, things to do, places to eat, etc. 

Please contribute all and any questions / thoughts / suggestions / ideas / stories / highlights about this travel destination, whether it be places you want to see or experiences you have had.

This post will be [archived on our wiki destinations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/topic-of-the-week) and linked in the sidebar for future reference, so please direct any of the more [repetitive questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/search?q=""Indonesia""+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) there. Please cick [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RX3YnlJHWfAFBv-7oZZha_d7S0BxXLGHUvnDqbOju_k/edit?usp=sharing) for list and dates of future destinations.

**Only guideline:** If you link to an external site, make sure it's relevant to helping someone travel to this city. Please include adequate text with the link explaining what it is about and describing the content from a helpful travel perspective.

&gt; **Example:** We really enjoyed the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. It was $35 each, but there's enough to keep you entertained for whole day. Bear in mind that parking on site is quite pricey, but if you go up the hill about 200m there are three $15/all day car parks. [Monterey Aquarium](http://www.montereybayaquarium.org)

&gt; 
&gt; **Helpful:** My favourite part of driving down the PCH was the wayside parks. I wrote a blog post about [some of the best places to stop](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27ve_written_a_blog_about_my_amazing_trip._i_want_everyone_to_read_it.21.21.21.21), including Battle Rock, Newport and the Tillamook Valley Cheese Factory (try the fudge and ice cream!).
&gt; 
&gt; **Unhelpful:** Eat all the curry! [picture of a curry].
&gt; 
&gt; **Helpful:** The best food we tried in Myanmar was at the Karawek Cafe in Mandalay, a street-side restaurant outside the City Hotel. The surprisingly young kids that run the place stew the pork curry[curry pic] for 8 hours before serving [menu pic]. They'll also do your laundry in 3 hours, and much cheaper than the hotel.
&gt; 
&gt; **Undescriptive** I went to Mandalay. Here's my photos/video.

Itinerary Help: Florida Keys,"Hoping some of you can help me out! My girlfriend and I were planning a trip down to the Keys in between some time in Orlando and Miami during September. The plan is to make the drive from Orlando to Key West stopping at some places along the way, but our first night in the Keys being Key West. From there, we would make our way back north to spend a couple days in Miami before flying home. The trouble is that it seems like there is a ton of things to do in the Keys and nothing seems *too* far away so I am struggling to try and schedule everything. Any thoughts on our list of activities (what we should add to the list, what we have that is over-hyped, etc.) would be much appreciated. Also of course, commenting on how much time you think we need to dedicate towards any specific activity! Below is the daily breakdown we are currently thinking:
- Day1: Leave Orlando early and stop for snorkeling at  John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo (2.5hrs). Once done, continue on our journey and stop in Marathon at The Turtle Hospital (~1hr). Complete the journey and arrive in Key West where we can do a tour of Hemingway House (1hr) and attend the Sunset Celebration in Mallory Square (2hrs) before hitting up Duval Street for dinner/drinks. (Lodging TBD)
- Day2: Free-time until grabbing lunch at Cuban Coffee Queen (1hr) and heading to Little Palm Island Resort/Spa. (Not too much detail on their website, but it seems like this may be under construction.)
- Day3: Islamorada - we'd like to hike at Long Key State Park, but their website lists no reservations through Dec/2019. I assume this is for camping and not a closure of the entire park, but still need to do research. (Lodging TBD)
- Day4: Start our drive to Miami and would like to include more road-trip stops like we did on day 1 along the way before checking into the Miami hotel.
- Day5: Open day for Miami activities (I am assuming heavy on the beach, but we'd love additional ideas as well as restaurant/night-time activities!)
- Day6: Same as above, but we fly out of MIA that night (after 5PM).

As you can tell, the other days are looser than the first so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",travel
What medium do you use to plan your travels?,"Hello Travelers! 

Wanted to see what methods everyone used to plan out their travels. Old school pen and paper? Apps? Word documents? A combination? 

I find myself using a note pad but when I have everything compiled, I end up rewriting the whole thing so it's actually legible... and then it's difficult to transport etc. It just doesn't seem like the most effective way, but it does feel good to have something solid. Wanted to check with the community and see what methods my fellow travelers are using.  

Thanks much and a great week to all-

Have you ever seen the church in the cave of the mountain? What if I say it is beautiful place in Cairo hidden from tourist? Lets explore!,"There was time in my life which I spent in Cairo, Egypt. I've lived and worked there for 7 months and all my free time I've dedicated to explore country with the greatest history (in my opinion). Beside The Great Pyramid of Giza, Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, fabulous Luxor &amp; Aswan and other famous locations there are magnificent places which is not that popular. 

Today, I would like to show you one of it. I was lucky to find it thanks to the project called ""Around Egypt in 60 days"" - the Egyptian couple who travels over the Egypt and showing the best places to visit on their Instagram. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Saint Simon the Tanner Hall &amp; ST. Mark's Church*

**First, lets read some facts:**

This huge cave was discovered in the year 1974. It was full of hundreds of tons of stones even up to the ceiling of the cave (which is 17 meters high from the ground), and was later prepared to contain ""St.Simon the Tanner Hall"" and ""St. Mark's Church""  
It was prepared to contain two storeys. The upper storey is ""ST. Simon the Tanner Hall"" prepared to accommodate 2000 people in spiritual meetings. The walls are decorated with many wonderful pictures engraved on the rocks representing scenarios from the Bible. The most unique scenery is of Jesus Christ opening His arms for all those who ask for Him.   
The lower storey is ""St. Mark's Church"", which was named after St. Mark the first preacher in Egyptian heritage. It was inaugurated in March 1993. 

The church dome at the Hall entrance is decorated from the outside by three great artistic pieces made of small colored mosaic , on top of the dome representing important scenes from the Bible ( crucifixion, Resurrection, rising to heaven).

**How to find it?**

It is  located in the Mokattam Mountain. First adventure is a short drive through the so called ""Garbage City’ – a large population of garbage collectors or Zabbaleen that live there. My advice to you - get some air fresher. It is smelly. But it worth it!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not so good in taking photos though I've attached some for you to share this beauty!

How Do People Travel?,"So my friend posted on Instagram a post about travel. How it was a choice and just a question about priorities and how everything she earns goes on stuff she wants to do 'today' and less focused on 'tomorrow' and says how everyone has a choice.

But I don't get it. Surely to travel you need savings, no? How do you pay for accomodation, food and all that if you're travelling? No one's going to hire you for a week! I'm struggling to pay rent in my own home and hardly have enough money for 'today'. Which also leads to, surely you need to be thinking in the future? Expenses coming up cost money.

I want to give up everything and go travelling so bad! I am happy to give up my life here but the furthest I could get is a couple miles down the road before my fuel runs out and I don't have the money to top up? It's just the money? How do people do it if they don't have saving or a re stinking rich or rich parents?

Sorry for the ranty questions, it's just really got me worked up thinking I'm doing something wrong when this has really been getting me down. But thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",travel
Would LA -&gt; SF or SF-&gt;LA make more sense (by car)?,"Hi guys,

I'm planning on spending a month in SF in October (and then flying to Mexico for Día de Muertos) and I was wondering if it would make more sense to fly into LA and drive up the coast and inland to Yosemite then back to SF or the other way around (SF &gt; Yosemite &gt; coastal drive down to LA after my month in SF). Also, is there anything else more out of the way that I might want to include in the LA-SF (or SF-LA) portion of the trip?

I was also thinking about getting a car for like a week there (i.e. separately from the SF-LA driving portion) and doing day (or overnight) trips to some places. I guess it would make most sense to visit places to the North of SF this way (Redwood National Park, Napa etc. - I guess Lake Tahoe is too far).

&amp;#x200B;

Before you say a month in SF is a lot and it's an expensive place, yeah, I know, but I like to explore slowly and am willing to spend money (within reason, so not like $15,000) on this portion of my trip.

Your input is much appreciated.",travel

"I live in Germany, my work is sending me to Texas and I have no idea what's awaiting me.","Hi there. I only know the US from Internet and TV and about Texas I know only two things:

Unique VISA to Schengen counties is making my head spin,"My wife and I are traveling to Europe in August and we would like to stay until December.

I’m also going to be taking Military flights. I planned on flying to London and then taking an EU flight to Norway. I could just fly to Spain, Germany, or Italy. I doubt taking a military flight lets me avoid the stamp but who knows?

I’m based in Florida and have looked into long term Visa appointments (5 hour drive) in Miami. They only offer to make an appointment for myself and not my wife. They also want flight and hotel info.

"Last few hours in Miami pn Monday, where to go near airport","Hey everyone!

I'll spend this weekend in Miami due to business reasons. My professional responsibilities end on monday \~2 PM (And I'll visit tourist spots on the weekend) and my outbound flight leave from Miami Airport on 7:55 PM (I think I should be at the airport around \~4:55 PM), so I'll have around 3 hours to do something.

I'll be around the [Blue Lagoon](https://goo.gl/maps/7uHPADksz84VLWsXA), and I was thinking in going to Dolphin Mall. According to google maps it's around **10-20m** [Blue Lagoon &gt; Dolphin Mall](https://goo.gl/maps/M1PD38CKjBPBprtq6), than around **10-20m** [Dolphin Mall &gt; Miami Airport](https://goo.gl/maps/MMKpWKbiPCfVHDGeA), meaning I'll have around 2 hours for some last minute shopping, arriving at the airport 3 hours before my flight.

Traveling to Cuba,"Hey Guys - As the title says, me and my GF are heading down to cube for a long weekend at the end of the month.

We have two out of the five days planned out with some Airbnb 'experiences'.  

One on 7/28  is a tour of a family cigar making business where we will visit a tobacco farm, a coffee farm, and do other outdoors adventures.  The description says all day so I am not worried about planning anything else this day.

Questions regarding routes and shoe recommendations for Dolomites,"Hello all! 

My boyfriend and I will be staying for 2.5 days in the Selva di Val Gardena area the first week of August. We are in our 20s and generally pretty sporty/active. I have done lots of hiking in the past but my boyfriend hasn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve done a lot of online research but are struggling to find 1 or 2 standout hikes we can do while we are there. We will stop by for a photo op at the Church of San Giovanni on the drive in from Innsbruck but so far that is all that is set in stone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Puez-Odle Altopiano is one we’ve considered, as we are more keen for a difficult hike with less people and rewarding views. While we have a car, I’m not sure though if trailhead parking lots are a thing there?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I just planned to take running shoes as I don’t have hiking boots at the moment, and just running shoes have been fine for day hikes with little weight in the past (also have strict EasyJet bag restrictions), but don’t know if that would be a bad idea for the Dolomites.

Where to go for one week?,"Hello! I am surprising my wife with a trip to Dublin this November.  We've both wanted to go to Ireland for a while and I'd like this trip to kick off an annual traveling tradition.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are both full time students and employees, so one week- ten days abroad is about all we can afford.  I'd like a trip somewhere in between ""I drive a 2 year old Mercedes back home"" and ""I eat Ramen every night"".  AirBnb based is great, and we're good with getting breakfast and lunch at stores in the country rather than restaurants.    I did a lot of research and saw this is quite possible in Ireland as we will have 5 days, after the two days of travel, in the city after travel and can do Killarney or such for one of those days.   


So my question is where are other places we could go next year where 5-10 days gives us enough time to see most of what that city/area is about?  I was thinking Geneva, but a very brief look into it showed that it's VERY expensive.  


Quick helpful info:  We're Americans. We would have about $4-5k each year for travel for the time being.  I'd like to see Italy, Germany and a Scandinavian country at some point.  Greece and New Zealand would be awesome!  Japan (the typical Tokyo/Kyoto trip is our ultimate travel want, so i think I'd need more time and money for that one).   What would y'all recommend?",travel
Bars in Paris,"Hi guys! I’m visiting Paris next month and I was wondering if you could suggest me some bars for a relaxing drink. Preferably reasonable prices and a good environment (not too relaxed or casual).  Locations like arrondissements 1,2,8,9,10 would be convenient. 
Thank you so much!",travel
Opinions on a Base in Spain in October,"Travelling to Spain in October with my girlfriend and will land in Barcelona, spend 2 days (we’ve been before, love it, but would like to explore onwards) then set up a base for the next 6 days - we don’t want to be on the move every 2-3 days. 

Currently thinking about Malaga, but open to other ideas (Alicante, Valencia, etc.). We want to be on the coast, so Sevilla and Granada aren’t it. We also considered Faro, but seems the beaches are a bit Far-O (I’ll see myself out) and the waters potentially chilly in October. 

About us: we’re in our early 30s, love food and drink, not into the party scene, like moderate hiking, cycling, beach, street art or the odd gallery, and just walking around a city for hours and taking it all in.",travel
Visa/esta request not completed,"Hi, I don’t know where to really post this on reddit. But I would appreciate the help.

I want to travel to america and started a request for the visa on a third party site. My girlfriend send me the site saying that she got hers from there (2 years ago). 
I started filling in the form without really reading. I filled in my credit card for the reservation payment. Not even knowing the price for a visa at this site. Afterwards I get a page with the  full form to fill in.  There I see a lot  of questions regarding legal issues which I need to fill in. I then stop the application because there are a few legal things I need to fix before applying for the visa. I figured this wouldn’t be a problem, because I only filled in my name and email address and stupidly filled in my credit card information.

I then immediately send them an email that I would like to cancel my reservation, because I don’t have the right information or documents to complete the application for a visa. 

They respond saying. I have used their service and because they did ‘work’ I cannot get a full refund. The price they claimed for 2 visa ‘requests’ was 178 euro. The price they are willing to refund is 50 euro. 

I am confused on what to do. I know that I was very reckless with filling in my cc information. 
I thought because I didn’t actually apply for the visa that this wouldn’t be a problem. I mean what kind of work can u do for a visa request without having information regarding the persons?

I would like to get some advice on what to do in this situation. I have contacted my bank and would like some more more information. 

Your help is truly appreciated,

The email they send me: [sparkmail](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/qk6E77vl00IrtIvfwyLQcKuLB4PqtbW4V6O6DrFT)

Travel Companies that can Help me Move with a Cat,"Hi all!

I'm hoping I can get some help with this. In a month I am moving from Boston to Edinburgh, Scotland with my cat, Henry, and I have mapped out a rough draft of how to get there (unfortunately, you cannot just fly in directly to the UK with a pet unless in cargo hold). However, it is fairly complicated and requires a lot of international calling to book the various means of transportation. Does anyone know of a type of travel agency that I can work with that will help me book my travels, confirm they are all pet friendly, and make sure that none of the dates/times overlap? Every time I do research, I only see travel agencies that do vacations etc., but I am moving there for school and just need help with my flight, ferry ride and train.

Thank you so much! Any leads would be appreciated!",travel

Passport through the wash? What a nightmare,"So, my passport and through the wash a few years ago. It looks to be fine, Ive looked online to see it fits within the boundaries of non destroyed passport, which is does. 

Pages are a little wrinkled, ID page is pretty much perfect apart from some wrinkles on one side. 
No pages missing etc. 

Am I right thinking this will be OK to fly with? I've asked some people irl who all say it looks to be okay.

Peru itinerary questions including how long to spend in Cusco?,"I'm heading to Peru on a solo trip in August for 12 days, first time in South America! My itinerary as of now looks like:

1. Land in Lima around 9am
2. Lima
3. Lima - fly to Arequipa around 6pm
4. Arequipa
5. Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek
6. Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek
7. Arequipa - fly to Cusco in the morning
8. Cusco
9. Cusco - Aguas Calientes
10. Aguas Calientes/Macchu Pichu - back to Cusco
11. Cusco - may get rid of this day in Cusco and spend an extra day in Lima to go to Paracas OR hike Laguna 69 - worth it?
12. Cusco - Lake Humantay trek
13. Cusco - fly home

Questions for people who have been to any of these cities:

1. Does my order of things in Cusco seem okay - giving myself enough time to acclimatize, not doing Humantay the day after MP, enough/too much time to hang out in Cusco itself?
2. Is Paracas worth the day trip since my schedule is tight? I have done a bit of boat rides along rocky coastline and wildlife viewing in various places around the world so I'm not sure if my time is better spent in Cusco/Sacred Valley.
3. I'm on the fence about Sacred Valley - if I ended up doing Pisac and/or Ollantaytambo, is the best option to go on my way to Aguas Calientes via train? Open to opinions on these places that would help me decide whether to stop or not. I'm not super interested in seeing a ton of ruins but the Pisac market sounds interesting and I'm sure I would enjoy the scenery.
4. Has anyone done the Humantay trek and what did you think of it?
5. The Colca Canyon 2 day/1 night trek looks great, I love hiking and am in great shape. I've heard everything about it from it's great, to it's extremely tough, to it's not that impressive - anyone have any more input?
6. Anything that won't pop up in a guidebook that you would say is a must-do in any of these cities? (somewhat off the beaten touristy path)

Thanks!",travel
How can I know if I have to leave transit area to catch my connection flight or not before buying the ticket in Frankfurt?,"My passport requires transit visa for German airports however since I have an Irish visa (including biometric data) I don't have to get one if I don't leave the transit area. It appears in some cases we have to collect our bags and go through security check again even if it's the connection flight is in the same airport, so that means I'll be leaving transit/international area and setting foot on German soil without a visa and violating my condition? 

How can I know beforehand whether I'll have to collect my luggage and go to security or either one those or I'll don't have to do both?

Asian Events / Festivals in October,"Hi, 

I just learned I was invited to a wedding in Hyderabad (India) around the beginning of October (this year). I'm from Europe, so obviously I'm super excited to go and discover a new place, and since I have to attend a conference in South Korea at the end of October, I figured it would make sense to stay in Asia for the 2 weeks in between. 

I haven't travel much in Asia - except Cambodia for a few months and Northern Vietnam for a week - and I'd like to use these 2 weeks the best I could, ideally by going to traditional/interesting events. 

So my question is: Do you know some cool/fun/traditional events that I could attend to in Asia mid-October? 

Disclaimer: I probably won't have 2 full weeks off, so ideally I would stay in an area where I can have a decent internet connection for at least a week. (I can take a week off).

Pay with local currency or credit card?,"I'm leaving in a few weeks for a 3 weeks vacation in Europe. I'll be visiting London (3 days), Amsterdam (3 days), Budapest (6 days) and Prague (8 days).

I'm wondering what would be the best way to pay for food and attractions. The countries we are visiting have 4 different currencies, so I thought that paying most of the things with my credit card would be the best and maybe get some cash just in case if it's needed. Am I wrong? 

Looking for any advice!
