Anyone ever used RailEurope ?,"Hello ! I'm planning a trip to Europe and I was recommended this website to purchase train tickets in Canadian dollars by my travel agency.

I made a purchase for a day trip between Paris and Reims. I completed the form, provided my credit card information and confirmed. My card was charged, but the ticket remain in my cart and I haven't received any email confirmation or ticket.

Needless to say I'm pretty angry. I contacted them by email (they don't provide a phone number) and I hope to get a answer back.

"Autistic with noise sensitivity, what are my cheapest accomodation options? What cities are best to enjoy/avoid?","Ok so, I'm autistic and have a phobia of loud crowds and audio. I'm having trouble finding accomodation that suits me.

I currently live in Melbourne, Australia and the CBD is a bit of a struggle but I'm just now starting to deal with noisy situations a lot better than before. FYI what I mean by noise that triggers me is mostly applause, loud cheering and roaring. 

First question, what is the cheapest accomodation without all the ruckus and loud people hostels and inns are known for?

Second question, what cities are good for me, as well as general advice for budget and hot spots to avoid (that are most prone to have loud crowds as described)

Travelling to Italy for the first time. Need help!,"Hello!

I'm planning on making a trip to Italy with my girlfriend in August. It's my first time travelling ""alone"", tho she has already visited Barcelona and Belgium. We're planning things ahead (flights / hotels / what to see / where to eat) so we can have a general idea about the costs / time we need to spare:

Our first plan was to visit Cagliari. We were amazed by the views and everything around the city. We also got interested in visiting the french island, north of Sardinia. We didn't really check any prices besides the flights (which cost around 60€ total for each person) so we're kinda lost on this.

However, we got **really** interested in making a 3 city-trip around Italy. Starting on Milan, travelling to Florence and ending up in Venice. Flight costs are pretty much the same as going to Cagliari (around 60€ total each person) but we kinda got lost when choosing an hotel + public transport to travel in between each city. From what we've seen, we can find Hotels for \~40€ (2 persons) each night around the cities but we have no clue if the train tickets (Milan -&gt; Florence / Florence -&gt; Venice / Venice -&gt; Milan) or the museums tickets are expensive or not.

Also, we took into account food and such. We plan on buying groceries and things to eat on-the-go but we also want to try out simple and economic restaurants if there's any.

Our budget is around 300€-400€ (each) and we plan on staying 6 days (5 nights) in Italy. Is it possible? Is our budget to strict? Are there any better options out there besides Italy / these cities?

Thanks!",Shoestring
Research trip in Japan (2-4 weeks),"This would be my first time in Japan. Planning for late March-April. 

Flying into Osaka ITM is the cheapest, about $840 CAD. 
I will need to spend a few days in Miyajima/Hiroshima and the same in Nara for my research. After that, I’d like to take some time to travel throughout Japan (number of days depend on cost - what can I expect to budget, roughly?). 

Should I stay in the same location and take day trips to sightsee, or should I book multiple stays, moving throughout Japan each night? What cities should I visit? I love art galleries and museums, cultural/heritage sights, nature, food, architecture. I’m thinking about getting the JR pass. 

Should I look for a homestay? Airbnb? Hotel? I’d like to be more embedded in the local culture. For my research I’ll need ideally a desk and internet and a place to store my laptop securely, but maybe this can all happen at cafes. Other than that I am not too picky about accommodations.

Is AirBnB really that great?,"Our trip (hubby and I) is to multiple cities and we were told we could save money by using AirBnB vs hotels. After looking at several and reading the fine print, I’m not convinced it’s better than a hotel. We’re still subject to check in and check out times and I don’t like how many of the AirBnBs are listed as the entire place when it’s the upstairs or basement portion and someone is living/staying in the other part. I’m beginning to think we should just go to a hotel. I looked at VRBO as well, but didn’t find their site user friendly.",Shoestring
People who have been to Rome- how much did you spend and do you have any tips in traveling in Italy?,"It’s been my boyfriend’s goal to be able to go to Italy at least once in his life. It would probably take us a while to save up but I’d like to ask on here now anyway because I like to get a sort of $$$ goal going. I’m not sure where else we will go but right now the goal is Rome (which I am currently researching)  although I don’t know how many days. So this would be more of an estimated goal rather than an exact one 

Please state where you started as well in terms of flying over or transport or whatever. I would be starting from Australia. 

My questions
1. My boyfriend would want to do a tour, but that means more saving up- would a tour be worth it or would it be better just doing everything ourselves? 

2. Is the true that it a restaurant only has Italian (no English) on the menu you can be sure it’s not a tourist trap? 

3. Do you guys have any recommendations of general areas to stay (probably in Airbnb’s)  that are close enough to things to see and do?  I plan to take some money to get transport as well

Canary Islands Surfing Trip Suggestions,"Hi guys,

A friend and I are playing with the idea of going to the Canary Islands. Some years ago we tried out surfing and whilst we weren't pros in the end, we had a hell of a time. Coming from Europe we were looking for destinations that are more or less near by and could provide good weather in April (and of course cheap flights). In the end we're not looking for the best waves but a place with chilled and young vibes. We are probably going to rent a car so traveling around on the island wouldn't be an issue. If some of you guys had insider tips on the Islands that would be awesome. Which island would you suggest? Some of them seemed a bit dry and rocky whilst others were green and had endless beaches.

"My corporate banking job is soul-sucking. I look forward to my next flight and holidays. I decided to take create a travel deal blog to enable more people to travel, shitty long-haul carriers not included","I am a late twenties person, working on my third corporate job. At present, it feels like my management wants to create plenty of ""good-to-haves"" and stuff - reports, tools that may be beneficial to someone at some point in the future, yet does not have any real impact on the business.  Thus, my work seems not fulfilling - I feel like I am not helping anyone step up their game or improve their knowledge and understanding of a certain subject. Yet my life, I feel, is decent  - I can afford travelling several times per year and it works magic for me in terms of learning and appreciating the things I have. However, life is not so rosy for those living around me. In my post-communist country, everyday I hear plenty of grumpy people with narrow-sighted fears and beliefs, seemingly living pretty decent lives, yet unhappy about most things. Part of this, of course, is the backwards system some of the used to live in. And, I feel, a big part of that unhappiness stems from being ignorant to other opinions, cultures and lifestyles, probably stemming from times when ordinary people were not allowed to travel. Why? This was essentially done to portray the communist world as the perfect one, thus taking away the opportunity from my parents and their generation to see the beautiful world around us, corrupting some of them from the inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided I want to chip in somehow, to try and enable more people, both my fellow countrymen and others, to see more of the world and at an affordable cost. How? I am writing a simple blog, where I post cheap flight deals, both short and long-haul. I am looking to find the best, inexpensive options providing the best price/comfort combination to fabulous destinations, and not some crap random places.

I will post plenty of Ryanair and EasyJet stuff - after all, their flight deals are hard to reject. But for long-haul, I will never recommend flying on some obscure poorly rated airline - I will rather spend much more time to find economy class seats on the best airlines available. People only assume that good airlines are expensive - there's always a cheap flight deal somewhere, and I am here to help them out.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to show people that there is so much to see and appreciate once we experience the world around us. There's always color in life and those, that are not restricted by some unfortunate mental or physical capacity, should have the opportunity to see it.

California Road Trip!,"Hey guys! I've been traveling ""light"" so to speak for the last two years and have been to Thailand, Mexico and the Netherlands so far. I have been set on continuing on to different countries but my boyfriend suggested a road trip so we decided to choose the west coast! I believe we will be traveling from Chicago at that time and we have about two weeks for the trip.

We will be renting a reasonable car and bringing camping equipment consisting of a basic walmart tent for four my sister gave me and plan on bringing a lot of snacks and ""camp"" style food. We will likely stay in a few hotels or airbnb's along the way as neither of us are experienced campers so tips on that would be good! I am also kind of scared to camp in the desert, should I be worried?

We both love adventure (he is a bit physically limited but is down for the ride) and we also like unique experiences. We both smoke marijuanna but neither of us drink so we arent worried about wineries and such. He enjoys people watching (the crazier the better), food and animals and I really love pushing my limits (skydiving, rafting, cliff jumping). 

I am a huge hippie at part so it is important to me to get a little spiritual on this trip. I am very interested in the energy vortexes in Arizona, Sedona specifically and I've been told to check out Mt.Shasta as well but I don't know much about the spiritual part! I would also love anything with caves or digging for gems. 

With our interests and time in mind, do you think we would be better off veering to northern California or staying in the southern parts? There is so much we could do! Neither of us is super interested in tourist trap areas (walk of fame, ect) but if it can be worked in as a quick stop I know my SO will get a kick out of it.

Trans-Mongolian Railway,"I’m interested in taking the Trans-Mongolian Railway from Beijing to St. Petersburg.

Some advice for budget traveling?,"Guys I have been doing solo / shoestring cheap traveling for a while, and while, i seem to be doing well on my own, can't help but feel that  probably you guys can probably show me something I'm missing.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I've been having, for instance, is, I tend to be a bit of a worrier - so - before I book my flights, I need to make sure that I have accommodation, as otherwise I get anxious. I know, looking on hostelworld should provide me with options (and yes, I know taht if I go to the hostel in person, I get the same offer for cheaper), but lately, I've also been having a blast with couchsurfing, as I've been enjoying the friendships and the fact that I can share my experiences with someone as well as that my budget can run me a little bit longer also, now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So thing is, this just happened (and it's not even the first time)... I was planning on visiting Berlin and nearby areas (prague, warsaw, and possibly more as I go), and I found some amazing deals. I saw a flight two-way for (E)50, and thought it was a catch - I considered buying it, and then hoping for the best, but something held me back. I spoke to some couchsurfers, sent out a bunch of requests, and then it took me over a week, for all the couchsurfers to confirm they could host me. (Most answered immediately, but one was a bit shaky), and thing is, by the time I knew I was ok, I went to book the flight, and realized it had tripled in cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course,  I set out to find some cheaper flights (I DID), and now i've spoken to my hosts, and hoping that they'll accept these alternative dates. But still, this leads to friction and issues. What do you suggest? 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I could just book a hostel, but unfortunately, I REALLY am on a SHOESTRING budget, and prefer to think of hostels as my last-minute emergency. I like hostels, but I was looking to make my money run a bit longer. What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I'm very grateful to couchsurfers who host me, in fact, I'm couchsurfing right now as I type this, I just arrived in Gozo last night to enjoy amazing carnival celebrations. I'm not annoyed at my host for delaying to answer and confirm,, of course. I know that family and issues easily get in the way and I am very grateful that somebody wants to open their home to me. I'm just looking on how to be a savvy traveler! I have some tips to share too! I just spent a week and a half in Barcelona!",Shoestring

Exploring Northern Italy for 4 days in the end of March,"Hey!   
\*disclaimer\* I am fairly new to Reddit  


Didn't find many posts regarding the part of Italy north from Milan so I might ask here. We are two students who plan to explore this part of Italy on a budget and we are flying through Bergamo Airport ( Friday noon - Monday afternoon) and renting a car to explore the charm of the lakes (Como, Garda, di Braies) as well as maybe visiting Venice on the last day. We love nature sights and peacefulness in general. **Is there anyone who has any recommendations regarding accessible 'nature sights' or little villages/cities worth visiting along the way.** Our current idea is to move in the following order Bergamo Airport - Lake Como - Lake Garda - Lago di Braies - (maybe) Venice/Burano - Bergamo Airport

One month in Bali!,"Hi friends! I am a solo traveler and I am planning on going to Bali for a month. I have never traveled this long but I am really enamored by the idea of staying there, or at least traveling around Indonesia for the duration of that trip.

That being said, would you recommend it -- staying there for a month? And how much would it roughly cost me? I also work remotely so it wouldn't be an issue. It's more of the budget that I'm concerned, especially because I am also coming from a 3rd world country and would really need to prepare before the trip happens. I also know that a lot of expats are staying in Bali, which most likely means that the prices are jacked up compared to the rest of the country.

I think I'm in trouble,"My husband, son, and I are planning a trip to England this June (we live in the Eastern US). We had to wait longer than I like to buy the airline tickets because my son's passport took longer than expected to arrive. I found an awesome deal on an airbnb for the dates we were planning, so I booked it last week without plane tickets, thus locking us into precise dates. Tickets for our travel dates were totally affordable until today (I was going to buy them today!), when they suddenly jumped by $200 each. How likely is it that the prices will improve soon? Or are they more likely to get even more expensive? Should I just buy them even though we really of can't easily afford the extra $600? I know I made mistakes here, and I also realize this isn't really a ""shoestring"" trip, but I thought maybe someone here would be more knowledgeable about ticket price trends than I am. Thank you for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: Thank you, everyone. I followed a lot of the advice you gave and I  managed to get some tickets that are much closer to our budget. Thank  you all so much!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit again**: Here's what I did: I cleared the cache and history and used a private browser. Then I went to skiplagged, and right away I saw ticket prices that were more like $700 a piece, rather than $800. That saved me three hundred dollars from what I was looking at when I originally made this post. Some people had suggested trying different dates, and I did look into that, but the days immediately before and after the date we were planning on weren't any cheaper, and any further change in dates would be difficult due to our work vacation schedules. So I stuck with the original dates. Finally, someone recommended that I ask the airline over the phone if they gave discounts for children, and it turns out that Virgin Atlantic gives a 25% discount for seats for children under 11, so that saved us a further $175. So that's a total of $1925 for three round-trip tickets from Boston to London in late June, rather than the $2400 I was looking at when I made this post. So you all saved me $475!",Shoestring

* In regards to sights, I prefer more nature sightseeing rather than museums and art
* Places with hostels preferably (I heard its very easy to talk to people at hostels, most of the time they might start up the convo which is my biggest issue)
* Place with a variety of food to try (be eating out every day just so I can try as much as I can)
* Good amount of nightlife. If I stay at a hostel, im assuming ill always find something to do but if not, a good nightlife environment would be nice so I can still meet new people at clubs, bars, etc.
* Not required but a dispensary would be a bonus, I've always wanted to go to one

My Shoestring 2016 XC Road Trip Itinerary &amp; Breakdown,"TL;DR: Moved across the country and made a road trip out of it with two friends. Spent \~$300 per person. Here is my itinerary/cost breakdown.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Reddit has become an invaluable resource in my travel planning and I wanted to contribute in some way. Hopefully someone can use it as a reference point in planning for other travels.

I had to move across the country after graduating college in 2016 and dragged my two roommates H and K along with me (e.g. we were all broke). We started in the Bay Area, picked K up from the airport along the way (she had a summer final to finish before joining us), and H&amp;K flew back to the Bay after reaching our destination.

This was our rough itinerary before we left, and I never got around to updating to include our last-minute changes on the road. I'm sure we could have done a lot of things better/others would have done things differently, but given our time crunch and preferences, this is what we came up with:

**Day 1 -- Friday, 8/12 || Las Vegas, Pick up K**

* **6:30am:** Drive to Las Vegas, eat lunch in car \[8 hours 12 minutes\]
* **3 pm:** Arrive, check into Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Food:**

* We had a $60 Costco gift card that we used to stock up on snacks and food (which we stored in our cooler) for the drives before leaving for the trip.
* One thing I was really excited about was engine-block cooking! We triple wrapped sausages in foil and stick it on the engine block, drive 30 min to an hour, take them out, and eat them as we continued on driving. Really perfect for after-hike snacks.
* The rice cooker was also great. We'd get frozen veggies and spam and mix it in with the rice and let it cook the night before/in the morning, and eat it later in the day. Or just make rice and eat it with our side dishes (we're Korean).
* The only times I remember eating out were in Boulder, Chicago, and New York (the cities we stopped in). All other meals (that I recall) were prepared by ourselves and eaten in the car while on the road. This definitely helped cut down on $$ and travel time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Money:**

* Gas: $203.43 (we tried filling up at Costco as much as possible, and I was driving a 2008 Hyundai Elantra)
* Sleeping accommodations: $376.88
   * We redeemed Airbnb referral codes for some reservations.
   * King Spa lets you stay overnight if you pay $12.50 more.
* Park fees/rentals/toll/parking/shuttle&amp;metro: $188.25
* Food (including Costco GC): $168.37
* Grand total (not including H&amp;K's flights back): $936.93Per person cost: $312.31

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Additional notes:**

* Thought that having 3 people was the perfect number for driving (one passed out in the back, one driving, one to keep the driver company). And for splitting costs. Four might have been too cramped in the car (since I was moving, the trunk was completely full with my belongings, and we were limited in space--but it's also just easier to sleep in the back when you have it to yourself!)
* We're millennials and don't carry much cash around... I completely forgot about tolls on the East Coast, and we were found scrounging around our car looking for enough money to pay the toll booths too many times than we should have.
* I'm planning another week-long trip to Utah (mostly) for this spring. Let me know if anyone's interested in that itinerary/how I can make any potential future posts more helpful!

Mexico City - the shoestring destination you didn't know about.,"Since this is r/Shoestring and most of the users here are probably from the USA I want to give a suggestion that few Americans seem to know about or consider..  


I know I didn’t..


Mexico City   (CDMX)


I first kept hearing about it here on Reddit and shrugged it off as “It’s Mexico”..  but it kept popping up in all different subs on how much people loved it..


So I went down the rabbit hole of research on here as well as a lot of Googling: Top 10 Mexico City/CDMX as well as YouTube..


It looked amazing, was incredibly cheap..  so decided to go.


My first trip was about two weeks and it was amazing, everything I thought it would be and more.. 


Usually a few days or so in a big city and you’ve kind of seen everything and I start to get a little bored.. but there was a lot more to do here than most cities..


Then another part of the Shoestring part:


About 6 months later I wanted to go somewhere for NYE..    I looked everywhere in the Caribbean and Central America and South America.. since it was the holidays, flights and accommodation were outrageous everywhere..  


I spent around $600 from what I remember correctly for 2.5 weeks.. this was for everything:  Flights, accommodation, transportation, food, entertainment etc.


Just the flight alone to somewhere like Cancun, Jamaica or Puerto Vallarta was more than my entire trip.


So we booked CDMX again.. this time it would be about a 2.5 week trip.


Cheap flights from the USA - we flew from Texas at $210 round trip


Amazing food:

Super cheap amazing street food 
OR
Very nice sit down meal and fine dining restaurants for $15+


Cheap accommodation - we did a private room in an AirBnB for $15 a night


Uber is like $2 for car pool for most of our rides


We basically walked or bicycled everywhere.. 

CDMX is one of the most bicycle friendly cities I’ve been in.. lots of bike lanes and the traffic is very aware and courteous.. and they have hundreds of kiosks where you enter in your code and off you go.. and then drop it off at another kiosk..  

Literally over 100+ of these in a very small area.. one on almost every block.


What to do:


The city has everything. 

Now I haven’t been there in over a year so I know I’m forgetting some main things but here are most of my favorites:


Historic cool old buildings and churches


Largest market in all of Latin America - La Merced (Go during the morning/daytime)


Tons of absolutely amazing parks - Chapultepec Park is the main one but there are dozens more.


Great city walk in with some really cool neighborhoods - Centro Historico, La Condesa, Polanco (rich area).


Great museums - don’t miss seeing the Aztec Sun Stone (Aztek Calendar) - it’s huge!


Bicycles!  - They also close down the main streets I believe Sunday morning so it’s a great ride though the city to see all the architecture and buildings


Lucha Libre - Mexican wrestling - Arena Mexico - I’ve always sat in the first or second row - they will literally fight in the stands right next to you - it’s like WWE on steroids - buy your tickets during the day from the actual box office.


Frida Kahlo House - the neighborhood and local market is nice too


Xhochimilco - boat rides through the rivers (Island of the Dolls is another option here) great for groups or a couple - some will have 20+ - it’s quiet during the week or a big party place on the weekends.. music, food, entertainment as you’re pushed along on a big bright colorful boat.  

Don’t forget to check out the Axolotls as I think this is the last place in the world where they exist.


Teotihuacan Pyramids - you can take the public bus from the north part of the city or hire a private car/bus.  Can’t miss.


A FEW OTHER SMALLER MUST SEES:


Sears Department Store coffee shop (tea and pastries as well) 8th floor - hidden gem - outdoor seating area with an amazing view of Palacio de Bellas Artes.


El Morro - legendary local place - 3-4+ locations - hot chocolate and churros - often an hour wait just to get a table


THE FOOD!   


Amazing food, amazing food, amazing food!  This can’t be said enough..  tacos tacos tacos


If you like Mexican food - you won’t want to leave.


I’m pretty well traveled at around 27 countries but this could very well be my favorite city I’ve ever been to.. 


If you’re looking for a place to go on more of a budget check it out, it may just work for you.


Watch a few Top 10 videos on YouTube and get a feel for it.


r/mexicocity is also a great sub for more info and itinerary suggestions


I’m just trying to spread the word to others here on Reddit as they did for me.

Is it worth it to make our way up to northern Ireland? Should we stay extra days anywhere else?

How to save money for a flight?,"Recently graduated student - looking at flights to Europe and other areas and surprised that they are well over $1000 for a flight.. how in the world do people save up this much money just to spend on the flight alone? That seems crazy to me when I think how many people fly on business trips, and how many 1000's of people fly every day, that's millions every day easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you save up enough money to actually get to Europe from NA? I just recently traveled from the east coast and drove to the grand canyon - down through texas and back again and it costed around $1000 for the entire trip and even that I thought was expensive and took me 2 years to save up for with my significant other.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some tips on finding cheaper flights so that way we can both go to Europe without blowing our whole budget out of the water just on the flight alone?

Thinking of going back to Eastern Europe over the summer,"I have family in Central-Eastern Europe (think Hungary-Poland-Czechia area, cousin probably in Germany by now) and would like to see about living there for a summer while working on improving my coding skills and saving money compared to living where I am in the US. I've been to the region three times by now, and while I am a little sick of it, it feels sort of like a second home? I have complicated feelings about it. Essentially, I don't think I want to live there for the rest of my life, but it would be nice to go back on my own without family involved much (which has been the case the other visits). 


I am currently considering going for two months/60 days, and am able to live like a local (since I've done that already for a decent period of time). I know the cheaper places to drink, how to shop at Aldi/Tesco/Spar on a budget, and if my cousin can live off of 500 euro a month in salary I can live off of about as much. Is $1,000 too little an amount, excluding airfare? I ask because these countries recently it seems have been getting more expensive.

\-budget: $5,000 USD including airfare and buffer. \[\~3,000 for 35 days backpacking/touristing\]

\-destination: If I had all the money in the world I would go all over Greece.

\-Regions/places: at the top of my list is Crete (like, all of it) and making a visit to Mt. Parnassus/Delphi. And I guess I'll spend some time in Athens while going between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

\-activities/desires: Pretty much mountains/nature, archeological/ancient sites, and monasteries/churches. Would like to find  a work exchange/wwoof or two.

Experiences or tips for camping abroad?,"I spent some time in South America and there in a lot of countries it's actually illegal and prohibited to camp in wilderness areas or preserves because of how it may affect the ecosystem. 

In the states, our national parks are open to all and in general here there's much more of a culture of outdoors, backwoods camping and being in nature.

Needless to say, I didn't do almost any camping in SA. There were places basically like hostels that offered you facilities and conveniently illuminated spaces near cities where you could pay to ""camp"", but this to me defeats the entire purpose of camping, which is to have more intimate relationships with nature. To find true silence and peace and beauty.

Anyway, I'm planning a long-term trip busking through some of the Pacific islands, Asia, the Middle East and eventually Europe.

I was wondering how others' experiences camping abroad have been? The good the bad &amp; the ugly? Tips or tricks you've found?",Shoestring

I want to get a sense of American history (East coast) on a budget. What is essential and budget/time-friendly? What is not worth the time/money?,"I did a 2-month road trip exploring the West last fall. I started in SLC and saw the best National Parks and cities in the Western US. Life-changing experience to say the least.

I want to do this again but on the East coast minus Florida (I've been here a ton of times and will go back at another time).

I am starting in Atlanta where I live where I will check out some civil rights history that I haven't seen after living here most of my life. I know what a shame. I've seen most everything else in Atlanta though.

Taking a Greyhound or train to DC to check out Smithsonian (again) and the Presidential Memorials (again). Open to explore a few other places but I did visit in 2006 and remember seeing Ford's Theater and Mount Vernon, so I'll skip these this time to save time and money.

Take a bus or train to Philadelphia for the first time. I know I have to check out the place where the Constitution was signed, some Ben Franklin history, also eat a really Philly cheesesteak for the first time. I don't eat a lot of meat but when I do, I want to get something authentic and memorable. Open to suggestions here for sure, not familiar at all.

Take a bus or train to NYC. Central Park. The Met. AMNH. Rockefeller Center, Top of the Rock, a VR show there called 'Spheres' (sounds amazing). Get a nice bagel/coffee to start the day, some sushi or something for lunch, some pizza for dinner. I want to see 9/11 Museum and Wall St too. I'm stuck here the most, how can I see NYC on a budget without needing to break it into another trip in the future? Is Couchsurfing or WorkAway a good idea here?

End the trip in Boston (been here before), so I don't have to see everything again. I have to check out the JFK Museum though, also Cambridge (I'm thinking about applying to Harvard's Extension School in the future). 

**Time** - I work remotely, so I am not worried about this. I am bringing work with me and can do a lot with just a few hours of sitting in a cafe or library.

**Money** - I am not broke but I like to travel with just a backpack. I enjoyed Couchsurfing when I tried it last fall.

Maui Hawaii in May (21/F),"Hi everyone! This will be my first international travel without parents or on a school trip. I will be going down with a couple friend in May of this year (2019). I'll be there for roughly 7-9 days depending on flights. Accommodations are cheap as we are staying in my friends family's condo for only $300 per person for the whole time (i.e a one time payment, not daily). I have already checked a couple of flights and got an estimate on how much it will cost (flying from Atlantic Canada).

I've estimated how much this trip will cost me with everything included and it comes roughly to $2000-$2500 with some extra spending money added in and roughly 75$-100$ a day for food and activities.

I'm just wondering if there are some must see and do's while in Maui and if there are things I can avoid or cut completely out of the trip to save some cash?

I haven't decided if it's worth it to rent a car (I'm 21 so it will be an extra 24$ young driver charge on top) or to just Uber where I/we need to go. I've never used Uber as we don't have it here in Atlantic Canada.",Shoestring

How to save on your travels? [Tips and Tricks],"There are many things to consider when you're preparing for a trip. What to bring with you, where to book a room, where to exchange money etc. These things are essential no matter where you go, but if they are done correctly and with enough research, they can also save you a pretty penny which can then be spent to see an extra sight or experience more things. But how exactly can one save on their travels? Here are a few tips.

First of all, you need to find the best deal when it comes to booking your rooms. There are many big and famous booking websites out there, but the one making all the news lately is [LockTrip](https://beta.locktrip.com/?refId=42100). This is because this platform is using the latest technology to cut out middlemen who usually take a significant chunk of the money you use to pay for a room. [LockTrip](https://beta.locktrip.com/?refId=42100) uses the freemium model to finance itself, which is why the prices on their website can be up to 30% lower compared to the competition.

Next, you need to be careful when exchanging money if traveling abroad. Not all exchange offices offer the same prices, so it pays (literally) to inform yourself a little, especially if you're planning on using larger amounts of cash. Larger cities sometimes have notorious exchange places where you get significantly worse deals, and if you're not informed you can easily miss that. This is often the case if the country you're traveling to doesn't use dollars, euros or something like that but has its own unique currency.

It is also a good idea to check out transportation options in the city you're visiting. Some have very efficient public transport systems, but in others it may be a good idea to use taxis or even Uber or something similar. Always check if it's possible to purchase a daily (or even a weekly ticket, depending on how long you're staying) ticket if you plan on using public transport a lot because they usually get you a nice discount compared to buying tickets individually. 

There are plenty more things to consider when making your plans, and to really make the most of your travels visit [onedayitinerary.com](https://onedayitinerary.com). They have loads of useful tips on cities all over the world and will help you make the most of every second of your trip.

REVIEW: Surprise Trips,"About a month ago I posted a message looking for some kind of feedback on surprise trips. I heard about it a lot but didn't know if it was really worth it or not. In the end, without too much feedback about it, I decided to try it anyways and booked a 3-day trip for $260. Taking into account that this price includes both hotel and direct flights I was really intrigued by the quality of the accommodation but surprisingly it was better than expected. We departed from Miami and our surprise destination was Austin (never been before but I'd heard some great things) and discovered such a cool city with a lot of things to do. The hotel was Hotel Indigo Austin, in downtown, and both flights were with American (first flight was early morning and the second was late afternoon, so it was long enough). The only thing I would ask to improve is the city guide that they send you (a lot of activities but too long and boring), I ended looking for some cool places on Pinterest. Definitely, very impressed for the quality-price ratio. Maybe I could have found something similar for approx the same price but the surprising factor is a temptation. I used [www.flynimbus.com](https://www.flynimbus.com) but I'm sure there are more companies doing this. I'm thinking about trying it again but this time in Europe.",Shoestring

25M Canadian with 10-15k &amp; anxious about money looking for adventure itinerary advice,"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

Apologize for the long post. TLDR at the end.

Doing a long-term (\~12 months or more) trip has been a dream of mine for about a decade now. I'm at a point in my life now where the timing is right (finishing my master's degree, doesn't know what to do next except for a phd) and I've been saving for a bit now in anticipation of that dream-trip. I'm also at a point where I just want to go away as long as I can (or want to). I expect to have about 10k by may + another 5k in savings. Ideally, the 5k would remain untouched so I can keep some financial cushion for when I come back, but I expect to tap into it anyway down to perhaps 1k.

All that being said, I have trouble on deciding on an itinerary. To be clear, I don't want a precise route to follow (I like spontaneity), but I can't decide on my starting point + general direction. I'm looking for an off-the-beaten-track, high in adventure route. I don't mind more hardcore stuff; I even look after it (some will disapprove (ahem r/solotravel ahem); that's fine). Although I'm not a veteran backpacker, I have experience with Asia and Africa. Basically, my highest interests are, in no particular order : Iran, Pakistan, Mongolia, India, Nepal, SEA, crossing the Atlantic by sailboat, potentially Maghreb. Iran and Pakistan being the most complicated visa-wise (you'd think being Canadian would help, go figure), yet some of the most interesting places! Also, cost of travel there vary depending on sources, ranging from 20$/day to 60$/day, which is way too much for my budget.

I'm aware I can't possibly do all those in one trip without taking a longer break and with more money. I already bought a cheap flight to London, where I'll instantly hop on another flight whose destination I have yet to decide. That's where you guys come in.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential itineraries:

\- Starting in East-Europe because of cheap european flights. Going north to catch the transsiberian to Mongolia. Go south through China, then SEA and finally India/Nepal. That was my first thought, then I realized I could probably do better.

\- East-Europe start. Turkey. The three Caucasians. Iran. Pakistan. West China. Mongolia. East China. SEA. India/Nepal. (Then somehow make all the way back for Atlantic crossing?) I can hardly see how I could do all of this with 15k.

\- Start in SEA. Circle throught China/Mongolia/India/Nepal. Then either Pakistan/Iran/Turkey/Eastern Europe, or the transsiberian. Pros: I start where it's cheapest and logistically simpler; I basically start form the other side of the world and find my way back. Cons: Plane ticket is 10x more expensive; even more difficult to get visas for Central Asia

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts and advice? Am I being too ambitious? How long can I expect to travel with 15k, assuming I'm willing to hitchhike and camp where it's doable?  


TLDR: About 15k in savings for a long-term trip through ""Eurasia"". Dunno where to start and which direction I should take. Looking to travel for as long as I can, so cheaper options are best.

Central America for 2 on $1200,"We’ll be flying out of Toronto CA. Looking to go at the end of May/beginning of June but this is flexible up until the end of August, when we both go back to school.

Nuremberg or Munich?,"Dear redditors,
My girlfriend and I are planning a trip to Europe between July and August. At some point, we’ll be visiting Cologne and then Prague. Our plan is to stay in Prague for 3 days before heading to Berlin. However, we’re still considering an extra stop between Cologne and Prague. The two options that we considered are Munich and Nuremberg. We would stay for 3 days in either of those two cities, but we don’t know what would be the best option.
Both of us are literature grad students with a particular interest in history and the arts (we prefer anything pre-1800). We both like museums and art galleries, but are kind of on a budget this time. And just as a random fact, both of us are vegan.
The question, then, is: Munich or Nuremberg?

Spent about $500 on our trip to and from Toronto (stopped in Niagara Falls too!),"We drove from Wisconsin and stopped in various places along the way.

 

We kept it low cost by staying at cheap airbnbs. First one was in Buffalo close by Niagara falls. Just 25 a night for a private room, $12.50 split. The second was a whole apartment in downtown toronto for about $60 or $30 split. We also did a lot of free/low cost activities such as Toronto Island ($12 i think?), CN Tower (about $35 just to go the top), and ice skating downtown (around $10). We also tried cooking instead of eating out and did things like eating pb&amp;j's at 3:00 in the morning at a planet fitness opposed to stopping at a McDonalds. Unfortunately we got in an accident halfway home, but her insurance covered it all so in the end it costed me nothing. Got a cheaper car and actually pocketed some profit lol.

Using Qapital to Save for Travel,"TLDR: An app that helps you painlessly save money for travel, get $5 free

For the past two years, I've been using this app called Qapital to save money. It connects to your bank account and allows you to save money for specific goals like a trip that you want to take or a piece of gear that you want to buy. You can set what they call ""rules"" on how it saves. So for me, it saves $30 every time the New York Jets win (which isn't too often) and $1 every time that Donald Trump tweets (a lot more often). It's a great way to save money without feeling like you're saving money. If you sign up with someone's referral code, you get $5. The person who refers you gets $5 too. If you download it on your own, no money at all.  If it sounds like an app that interests you, I'll leave my link below. Let's spread some cash so we can all keep traveling.

Advice for this flight scenario?,"I've located a plane ticket from Newark (EWR) to Paris (CDG) for around $375.  This flight makes one stop in Charlotte, NC (CLT).  I actually live in NC so it doesn't make sense to drive to EWR just to fly back to CLT and then on to CDG.  The problem is that the exact same flight if booked from CLT to CDG is $1125 (presumably because it is considered nonstop).  Can I purchase the EWR-CLT-CDG ticket and then board the plane in CLT or will I get in trouble for that?  What other solutions might there be?

**UPDATE** 
So I did call the airline just to talk through it with them and they did confirm some things:
- if you don't make the first leg of your trip, all other legs are canceled.
- if you miss any leg other than the first leg, the rest of your trip *may* be canceled (but probably won't be if you contact them in advance or have extenuating circumstances)
- the pricing and logistics of this trip in my situation ""doesn't make any sense""... seriously, the lady on the phone told me that.  She said I'd be better off financially to buy a one-way ticket CLT to EWR plus the round trip EWR to CLT to CDG!",Shoestring
Solo NZ (6 day) &amp; Aus (16 day) Road Trip - Mid-Sept,"Looking for feedback on my trip. Prioritizing time &amp; experience on this trip since I'll be solo and the priority locations are so spread out, especially in Aus. Not as shoestring as may be typical on this sub, but I'm doing my best to keep it cheap &amp; would love feedback on cutting even more.   


Flight summary: Multi-city, rough estimate:  
USA --&gt; Christchurch, NZ (6 days)  
Auckland, NZ --&gt; Sydney, Aus (16 days)  
Sydney, Aus --&gt; USA.   


**Part 1: New Zealand.** I wanted to do both islands but round-tripping it takes time &amp; $, as does standard one-way options. I found that by using [https://www.drivenow.com.au/onewayrentals.jspc#/relocations/NZ](https://www.drivenow.com.au/onewayrentals.jspc#/relocations/NZ) I can coordinate a vehicle in advance, which I can drive cross-country for $5/day, so my biggest expense will be gas. On top of nearly eliminating a car rental &amp; hotel/hostel costs, it opens up freedom to set my own schedule &amp; itinerary, and I can hit most of the places on my list, even staying in the rural areas instead of cities if I want. Total anticipated cost for 6 days in NZ: just shy of $500 ($380 is diesel). Highest priority travel stops: [https://goo.gl/maps/SyZtspQ1Ksz](https://goo.gl/maps/SyZtspQ1Ksz) \-- I welcome any input/suggestions!  


**Part 2: Australia.** I've been to Aus before and will return again, but this will likely be my only solo trip for a long time. As such, I'm setting a rather aggressive itinerary to see all the out-of-the-way stuff that interests me - 5800 miles in 10 travel days, with 5 days for rest, scheduled events, &amp; exploration. I'll be doing something similar as the system in NZ, but because of the distance I'll be using a passenger van that should improve my efficiency, even if it leaves me tight on space. I estimate $2000 in vehicle rental &amp; fuel, with probably another $400 in ""extras"", but will be able to save on lodging by camping in the back most nights. What I'm really keen on is making sure I hit as many highlights as I can on the route I've got. I'm linking my travel day itinerary below - if there are highlights anywhere near my route that I've not included, or ways you can think of to help cut my costs even further, please let me know!

Planning a trip around NW Europe (coming via Calais from the UK). Is it better to drive or to hope on trains/buses?,"Hi all!

My partner and I are planning a month-long visit this summer around North West Europe, we will either sail (in car) from Dover to Calais, or fly from London to somewhere in France. 

Our rough itinerary includes: Lille, Brussels, Antwerp, Amsterdam, then back down to Maastricht, Luxembourg, then back through France.

I am a keen driver and there is a max of 2 hours between each location. We would stop in each place for 2-3 days so I wouldn't be driving every day. However, my partner doesn't drive so it's just me, and I sometimes get stressed when trying to follow directions, especially on the other side of the road I am used to!

I know my car, it's 10 years old but a reliable Mercedes. I would budget around £20 a day for petrol (driving days only). It would allow us to come and go as we please, and stop anywhere we find interesting. However, trains would allow me to relax more (and drink!). 

Does anyone have any advice on which would work out cheaper, especially considering there are two of us? And just as importantly, which experience might be more better generally?
