Traveling Easter/Central Europe,"My husband and I are so excited to be leaving for Europe next week!! We have a lot of things nailed down but would love any additional advice about things to see, affordable local cuisine, ect.  Back at home we love hiking, beautiful nature, playing games, food, and beer. I am SO excited about all of the food!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into many tours in the different cities so that we could get a locals point of view but it is just not affordable for us and therefore I am reaching out to Reddit to get some really good recommendations, especially for restaurants where we can taste local food.  I am also interested in learning the specific foods we should seek out in each city.  I can look at a hundred lists online but hearing from a real person who is from there or has traveled there would be amazing!

&amp;#x200B;

We are going to Prague, Krakow, Budapest, maybe Bratislava, Vienna, Munich, Chur, Near Lago Blanco (not sure of the town name, gmaps has me all kinds of confused), Varenna, and Milan.   We are taking the Bernina railway from Chur down through Switzerland over two days so I am also open to suggestions along the route as well.  We are definitely on a budget though so plan to mostly hike around and enjoy the scenery in Switzerland.  

&amp;#x200B;

We also have the opportunity to take a day trip on day from Milan and I am wondering the best foodie city to head to.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all in advance for the recommendations!  I am beyond stoked for this trip!!!!",travel
Spanish Honeymoon Itinerary Ideas,"I'm getting married in January of next year and one of the places my future wife has always wanted to see for the majority of her life is Spain.  I've never been either so I figured it would make for a great honeymoon destination.

I've gone ahead and booked our plane tickets so that we will arrive on February 6 in Barcelona and we will be departing Barcelona on February 15 (8 full days).  Early brainstorming ideas led to us thinking that we would like to have the trip structured around Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville.  (But we're both open to seeing whatever since we haven't made any accommodations yet)

Our basic idea was to arrive in Barcelona mid-day at the beginning of the trip and stay one night to recover from jet lag since we'll be flying from Houston, Texas.  The morning after we arrive we'd take a train to Seville and work our way back to the northeast to Barcelona.  We had intended on leaving the last couple days for Barcelona so that we can relax prior to flying back home.

Other cities which I've heard are nice to visit are Toledo, Cordoba, Grenada.  We're not looking to be constantly hotfooting around since this will be a honeymoon so we're looking for a leisurely and fluid itinerary.

Both of us love architecture and food and drink.  My future wife loves the coast and culture, I love history and rugged mountains.  We'll have a budget of around 5k so we have flexibility but can't really go overboard.

Do any seasoned travelers or Hispanophiles on this subreddit have any itinerary suggestions, tips, advice that you'd like to share?",travel

Male Presence in Greece,"Hello all I’m new to this travel thread, but I am traveling as a solo female at the moment through Greece and I thought this might be the place to ask about this issue! Has anyone else felt a bit weirded out at times by the predominantly male presence in a lot of cafes and eateries in Greece? Maybe I notice it more because I am on my own, but there are not a lot of ladies in these places to the same extent of males. I just wander if others feel the same?

[Advice] Itinerary for 9-day trip to the Amalfi Coast!,"Hi all,

My GF and I (mid-20s) have planned a trip to the Amalfi Coast late this summer and are looking for advice on our itinerary. Would appreciate any tips or suggestions for things should look into (restaurants, tours, transportation methods, day trips, beaches, etc.). The dates and hotels are all fixed and cannot be changed. Thanks so much!

Day 1: Arrive in Naples ~8pm local time and staying at a hotel in the city. Plan to just grab dinner and crash. 

Day 2: Head to Positano in the morning (is the best way to do this just pay for a private car? We are both pretty susceptible to motion sickness and have heard the bus can be a nightmare. Any recommendations for safe and affordable options?)

Day 3-7: We have a spot in Positano for 6 nights (I know this is a lot, but we had an amazing deal at a place and needed to stay for the extended period). We enjoy hiking, eating and drinking good food (but not Michelin 3-star fine dining), hanging out at the beach, scenery and photography. Any recommendations for day trips and how to go about them (i.e Amalfi, Sorrento, etc.), or if we are better suited to just enjoy Positano and not mess around with busses and traffic etc.?

Day 8: Head to Capri early morning on ferry and spend the night (any need to pre book or get there early for ferry from Positano?)

Day 9: Spend the morning / early afternoon on Capri and catch a later ferry to Naples (is there a risk of this being full in early September / is there a way to prebook). Spending night in Naples at a hotel near airport. 

Day 10: 9am flight home out of Naples",travel
Is it reasonable to try to see Yellowstone and glacier national park in 1 week?,"Hello everyone. I'm sure you see these type of threads a lot but I need some advice. I'm doing a spur of the moment trip with my dad to Montana for mid to late July(we're coming from Florida). This will be the only opportunity we will have to take a trip like this to this part of the country for the foreseeable future.

​

He says he wants to see it all. I know there's countless things to do, but we're mainly focusing on sightseeing and we enjoy scenic driving. Is it reasonable to try to see Yellowstone and Glacier National Park in the same trip over a 1 week span?

​

A tentative plan I've put together is flying into Bozeman, drive and stay near yellowstone for the first day, spend the next day in the park, drive up to East Glacier over a 2 day span(Checking out towns along the way), Spend the day driving west through the park, then ending up relaxing in Whitefish then Kalispell for the last day or so. And finally flying back out of Kalispell.

​

Is this reasonable and enjoyable? If you had to pick one or the other which would you choose? I haven't booked any accommodations yet and I know those fill up fast but we don't mind sleeping in the car if we need to. I appreciate any input or insights.",travel

Looking for a summer retreat for me and my fiance,"Hello, 

We want to celebrate our time together so we figured we should go for a magical trip! We are from Norway and we will be travelling from Oslo. We have thought mainly about Asia/Africa. As we have travelled extensively through Europe. The Caribbean could also be an option. 

Length is 12 full days

Budget is Somewhere around $5000, including flights, would be good. Less than that would be better. We like nice hotels, but we would also like to have the possibility to both see things and have some days at the beach. 

From before have we travelled in the following countries in Asia that we dont want to revisit: Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Israel, vietnam.

For climate we would really like something tropical due to the vast coldness of a norwegian summer. We are travelling in september this year.

Our interests are hikes, and food. We love tasting food from all over the world and we are not picky! As I mentioned before I would like to have the possibility to see something special and have the closeness of a beach. (For my fiance). When it comes to music we really like live jazz, blues and Cuban style.

We dont want to get robbed or mugged on our trip only precautions we have. We are fluent in several languages; Italian, Spanish, polish and english as well as the nordic. 
(No Finnish:( ) 

I'm a little stuck, so any help would be great.

Finding good travel insurance,"After reading some old posts in this subreddit, I decided to buy travel insurance for my wife.  When I search [insuremytrip.com](https://insuremytrip.com) or other sites, I find a variety of companies with similar offerings.  When I search for those companies, I find that there are always a lot of bad reviews, with two stars or less on sites like yelp.

I realize that the people with bad experiences may be more likely to leave reviews, but how can I evaluate an insurance company without just taking a chance and hoping that I get a good one?  I want to buy travel insurance, but am really apprehensive about who to go with.

Travelling to New York:,"Hello,

Me and my partner will be travelling to NY for five nights in June next year. Staying at the Grand Hyatt New York is that helps. (Booked early because I wanted something to look forward too!) 

There were a few questions I’ve struggled to get answered from google. I’ve contacted the hotel and still awaiting a response. 

I know we have to pay a $30 resort fee per night of stay at the hotel. I’ve had some conflicting information- is it best to take a spare credit card with us to use to pay this? As well as using this card for the deposit they like to take in case anything happens to the room? 
- I’ve heard it’s not good to use a debit card. 
Is there then tax added onto this $30 fee? 

Our check in is at 16:00pm and we arrive in Manhattan at around 14:00pm. They said we can head to the hotel and ask if we can check in early but it depends on room availability and how busy they are. Although they said we could leave our bags at the hotel whilst we go out and explore. Would we expect to have to pay for this privilege? I’ve researched local storage facilities for luggage and there are some cheap ones. I wouldn’t want to use the hotels and get stung with a heavy fee. 

What are some of your personal recommendations. We have a whole list of standard tourist places to visit but I love to find quirky attractions/bars/restaurants to really make a trip special.

Where to go on my trip to Italy in late-October,"I have a trip scheduled to Italy (flying in to FCO) October 19-28.

25F seeking advice on where to spend five days in Europe!,"Hi! I apologize for the lengthy post, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible! I need advice for where to go during one leg of my upcoming trip to Europe August 3-18! Here is my itinerary:  


August 4:  Arrive in London at 1:15PM (just staying overnight with a friend before my flight out the next morning)

August 5-8: Lisbon solo trip (roundtrip flight booked, and stay at Yes! Hostel booked)

August 8-12: Back to London, arriving at 4:25PM on the 8th. Spending the long weekend with family.

**August 12--16:** **UNDECIDED**

August 16-18: Back to London. Spending the weekend with a friend. Heading home at 8:50AM on the 18th. 

\*\*\*side note:  I know my scheduling seems a bit odd, but I have to be in London the 8-12 and then again the 16-18 for commitments I made with family and friends, but I didn't want to spend ten full days in London as I've already been twice before, so I want to take another little trip between.  


So all my travel and accomodations are taken care of except what to do August 12-16. I most likely be spending this part of the trip with a friend, but there is a chance I might be going solo, so I'm looking for a place that would be safe for a solo female traveller. 

**Budget:**   
Willing to spend around $200 round trip from London to whichever destination I choose. I plan to be staying at a hostel, hoping to stay to $50 or less per night. Not too concerned with anything else budget-wise.

**Interests:**   
\-I really like the idea of somewhere that has beautiful beaches, so on the coast or an island. I would love to do some sight-seeing, but nothing to fast paced. I want this to be a low-key, relaxing trip.  
\-Good food (duh)  
\-I love going out to bars/pubs, but NOT clubs  
\-Somewhere that is accessible via plane/train and easy to get around via public transit and/or walking and/or taxis/ubers. I will not be renting a car.   


I had some places in mind that I would love any feedback on. But I also would be open to literally ANY suggestions you might have based on my budget/interests!

**-Ibiza and/or Palma**

**-Amalfi Coast, but staying in Amalfi or Positano (I've already been to Sorrento). I think I would probably fly into Rome on the 12th, spend a night there, then leave early on the 13th to head to Amalfi or Positano.** 

**-Split, Croatia with possible trips to** **nearby islands.** 

My main questions/concerns with these locations: Are they easy to get around without renting a car? Are they good places to visit solo in case my friend isn't able to join me?   
**Also wanted to note, I have already traveled to these places and would like to avoid revisiting:**

\-Amsterdam

\-Paris

\-Florence

\-Rome (would be willing to spend a night here to get to the Amalfi Coast, but don't want to make it my primary destination)

\-Cinque Terre

\-Athens

\-Delphi

\-Frankfurt

\-Baden Baden

Help please! WhatsApp/FaceTime call from Dubai,"Hi everyone I’m new to Reddit 

I am traveling to Dubai in a few days and after hearing from my friend just today that you can’t use WhatsApp calls/FaceTime calls, I came across something called VPN.

Cambodia: Interesting stops between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap?,"I am headed to Cambodia in April, and will be taking my touring bicycle with me as my main form of transportation.

The ride from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap is roughly 200 miles, which I can break up into whatever size chunks I want since Cambodia is so flat. If I need to do 100 miles in a day that's not a huge deal.

Travel tips for two weeks in August outside Europe?❤️,"Hi people,

My girlfriend and I will be traveling for approximately two weeks (a little more would be okay as well) in August somewhere after the 4th of August.

We are looking for a place outside Europe since we have seen plenty of this continent already (despite that there is still plenty more to see). 

At the moment our preferable options would be Japan or Colombia. However, Japan will be very difficult since we have 1500€ as budget per person (excluding flight) as maximum. And unfortunately the flights from Amsterdam (where we reside) to Colombia are very expensive at the moment which will deplete much of our spending budget. Besides, many other options cannot be taken into consideration because of heat (India) and monsoon seasons like in South East Asia. 

As to what we like I would say; we are open to every option actually. But would like to exclude Indonesia since we were there last year. 

We really hope you guys can help us out and all the other fellow readers who struggle with the same question!",travel

United offering me 1:20 hr. connection in Houston from an international flight?,"I'm checking flights to New Orleans from Mexico for December, and United is offering me a pretty good deal on a MEX - IAH - MSY with 1:20 for connection.

I know the rule of thumb is that, if the airline offers it, you will be able to make the connection, but am I being overly paranoid in thinking that I'm not gonna make the connection? For me, anything less than 2, 2.5 hours when coming in from an international flight is way too short of a time to make a connection.

I want to take it, because it's the best flight option I've got so far by far, but I don't think I will, knowing I'd probably miss the connection; but still willing to hear opinions on the matter.

Do you think it is inappropriate for someone with chronic ptsd and schizoaffective disorder to pre-board a flight?,"Waiting in the airport now. Did it on my last flight and now I am feeling guilty. I can walk, see, no mobility issues. 

Navigating the airport is a different story all together. Under the stress I forget where I am, where I am going, what is going on ect. So I do really, really need navigation assistance. It is weird and feels wrong that they put me into a wheelchair whether I say I need it or not. I really just need someone to walk with me but I guess they do not offer that.

But preboarding? I get off the plane just as fast as anyone else does and I have to sit and wait for an airport assistant to pick me up at the gate anyway. 

Sure, crowds give me a panic attack- but it is over in like 2 minutes... then I am in my seat.

What is your opinion? Last flight I requested seats closer to the front because I needed to get assistance on short notice with the airline and help with baggage re-check (in a huuuge airport that has trains in-between terminals).",travel

Has traveling to a city you once awed just felt less special after you've been there?,"It's kind of a hard feeling to describe, it's like the Woody Allen line ""I'd never join a club that would allow a person like me to become a member"".

It seems to me that a big part of the allure of a destination is just having never been there, and seeing the pictures, videos and stories on the internet just built it up like crazy--kind of like admiring a celebrity and once you talk to them you just realize they're human.

Similarly once you travel somewhere you just realize it exists like anywhere else, and then you leave it and you realize travelling there wasn't necessarily something you earned a right to go there like it is with some other things in life--it was just the ability to pay for a plane ticket and take the time to do it.

Just Came Back from Cairo...uhh whoa,"I don't think I have been anywhere as intense as Cairo. I got hassled EVERY time I was on the street, constantly without exception. It got to the point where I started living in this reality where nothing anyone said was real and everything was a complete utter lie. I was with my (white, western) girlfriend and I felt like I was her hired security detail just to get her from site to site. I am Asian and I am not sure if that is what caused more attention or not. Even when I was on the street without her, I got hassled by everyone except a select few who were wearing suits. 

I would say it was still worth it to see the pyramids, because they are just on another level of majestic greatness. But, it required A LOT of everything. A lot of patience. If they didn't have Uber (or Careem) there, I would say this place would be 100% not worth to go. I can't even imagine having to deal with scam taxi drivers on top of the scam hustlers everywhere else. Literally, every restaurant, every salesmen on the streets, every person approached me even to just go to the grocery store was out to get to my wallet. If I bought beer at Drinkies in Tahir Square, EVERYONE knew what was in the black bag and desperate to get me to buy them alcohol. (I was told that yes anyone is allowed to buy alcohol but they do not want to be seen purchasing alcohol.) I had one guy BLOCK my elevator to beg me to buy him some beer and I had to physically move him out of the way and threaten him until he backed off. That's how far they are willing to take it. I had TWO people use their bodies to block my Uber to the pyramids to claim a guide is required and that they were the guy to take. Yes, you read that right they got HIT by my Uber driver's car to force him to stop! 

&amp;#x200B;

If my girlfriend was more than a meter away from me, she got SURROUNDED by local Egyptian men. Hassled. Groped. The moment I reappeared, they scurried away like rats. It was truly insane. Morocco was Disneyland compared to this. I read that \*\*99%\*\* of Egyptian women have been sexually harassed. If I didn't have a little imposing size and a trained fighter, I am not sure how I would feel walking around Cairo with a woman. Unfortunately, no was not accepted as an answer until I forced it to be the answer - I have never in my extended experience of traveling had to resort to being physical to get hustlers to back off. Even a proper gift shop across from the Egyptian Museum tried to lie to me and give me wrong change scam! Just shameless.

&amp;#x200B;

"Seeking EC 261 compensation for not being put on next available flight after ""extraordinary circumstances"" caused missed connection.","My relatives had a connecting flight from JFK via CDG on AF.

I was on (Facebook) Messenger with an AF rep while the plane was still taxiing, and they refused to move them to that flight, citing limited availability. That flight was not bookable with cash on AF's website, but it was bookable with Flying Blue miles on AF's website OR with cash on the carrier's website.

Help please!,"A very long and harrowing tale, please stick with it. 

My friend and I are travelling on the very very cheap, and had booked all of our Accomodation through Airbnb months in advance from home. For the most part we’ve done pretty well and gotten good locations, others we’ve gone a bit out of the way assuming public transport would save us. 

Our 2 month trip started yesterday, she flew in at 5:45 and I met her at the airport (having been here on a tour 2 weeks already). From the airport we got a train to Tiburtina, and then jumped onto the metro to Rebibbia where we were supposed to get the bus to Pisoniano. This is where it all fell apart. Every time we had asked for help, trying English, broken italian and using translations to show people working in information booths, we were turned away because they didn’t know. By the time we got to where we needed the bus, the direct bus had stopped running and the indirect bus was about to, we didn’t know how to use that and both of our phones were soon to die. The drive from that bus stop to our Accomodation was meant to be about 31 minutes, so we made the decision to use a taxi (fully aware it would be expensive). 

The taxi came, we got in, and the driver makes it to a toll gate before telling us it’s not actually in Rome so he’s going to need to charge double the metre for the return. By this point, it’s past 9pm and my friend and I are both exhausted so we say sure, whatever, there’s really nothing else we can do at this point. The trip takes closer to an hour, and the metre ends up at $82 - the driver charges us $145 rather than a direct double. My friends travel card which was connected to the app wouldn’t work, so we tried adding my card to pay with that - no luck. Eventually we scraped together just enough, using ALL the cash we had and finally made it out of the taxi and to the Airbnb.

 It’s an independent one, so the host isn’t here to let us in and we struggle for 10 minutes trying to open the door before finally giving up  and asking some lovely neighbours for help. Straight to sleep, plans to fix things in the morning. Morning comes, we’ve seen the request to cancel 3 nights of our reservation ant this Airbnb and have booked a hostel closer to where we need to be. We head off in search of a grocery store to buy food and bus tickets so we can leave tomorrow, find a bar and get some sandwiches, try to buy our tickets and snacks - only cash allowed, and obviously we have none. The lady very kindly gives us our sandwiches for free, but we cannot pay for anything so obviously can’t take the bus tickets with us. Can’t find an ATM or a bancomat ANYWHERE so eventually give up and come back where we need to ask help AGAIN in opening the door. 

Now, we have no idea how to buy our bus tickets to get out of here, the Airbnb host has declined our change in reservation and we still have no cash aside from a few euro in coin, (but not enough to pay for the sandwiches as well as bus tickets), only cards. What are our options?

Our nearest international airport is O'hare in Chicago, and we are in the central time zone. We are considering several countries in South America. Peru is a bucket list destination but when we go to Peru, we'd like to hike the Inca Trail and we don't think wet season is a good time to do that. I've heard wonderful things about Colombia and airfare seems reasonable right now! Even though I mentioned that we might be Europed out, I would be interested if there is somewhere that has Christmas markets and lights up that early... but best case scenario is that we can go somewhere that is similar to our time zone, and isn't too far away.

Hong Kong currency changers tend to be pretty honest,"They are very upfront with you, there are no hidden fees, and the commission is pretty low. I found it to be around 5% city-wide, even at the airport. I got 4.5% at the airport and at a street side exchanger, I would have gotten 5%. Hard currencies like CNY, USD, EUR, JPY, and CAD trade at a lower commission than less widely used currencies or more foreign currencies like NZD or MXN.

The rate they list already has commission factored into it. If they say 1 USD equals 7.4 HKD, they will slide 7.4 HKD across the counter when you hand over one dollar.

The following line is printed onto every receipt (keep the receipt!): A customer may cancel an exchange transaction within 3 days and obtain a refund if the original currency tendered in exchange for the Equivalent Amount shown above if the money changer fails to comply with the [Money Changers Ordinance \(Cap. 34\)](http://www.msoa.hk/faq_mco_en.html).

Oh, and don't be alarmed if they give you a paper $10 banknote. Not all of them are polymer. You should also thoroughly check for bogus CNY notes before you leave because Chinese counterfeiters are really good at what they do.",travel
Emergency Help with Short Layover!,"My flight from Hanoi lands in DMK Bangkok at 10:45 and I have a different flight with another airline at 12:20 going to Tokyo... long story but yes, I know it is close. I was not able to carry my bag and had to check it. I also have to get my ticket from the ticketing gate when I land in DMK...

My next flight is Bangkok to Tokyo and then to the US. I have the QR code for the second leg ( Tokyo to US) but it says I need to go to the office to get the ticket for Bangkok to Tokyo.

I am trying to prepare for what will happen. Do I just book it through immigration and try to grab my bag and go to ticketing for my new ticket? Does anyone have any suggestions to help? Are there any services that retrieve bags and forward them if I leave my bag at baggage claim in Bangkok so that I can make my next international flight? I know it’s a bad situation and I’m extremely stressed and would appreciate any help!!!

I have also seen people help passengers go to make connecting flights and lead them, but I’m not sure if that is just for different scenarios or if there is a way to organize this. Just trying to consider any and all options.",travel

Vietnam for 18 Days - Help Needed,"Hi everyone. 

Long time lurker, first time poster etc. so sorry if I mess anything up. 

I will be flying to Vietnam and meeting my friend who lives in Hanoi, then we will travel around the country. I have done some prior research, and decided to stick to north and central Vietnam due to the shorter itinerary than I’ve seen on here (a month or so) and reading that the south can be less spectacular (though still amazing)

The places I have so far:
- Hanoi
- Sa Pa
- Ha Long Bay via Cat Ba Island
- Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park
- Huế
- Hoi An

How long would you recommend to spend in these places? In what order to travel to them? Any advice in general would be appreciated.

I was looking at Ninh Binh as well, but think this may be excluded due to time constraints. We will be travelling by plane mostly as my friend has connections to the airlines, but other options are welcome.

It’s my first time flying and travelling so sorry if these are stupid questions. Thanks for any help!

12-14 day trip - central location suggestion - Europe or South America,"Planning a honeymoon for next February or March. We wanted a place where we can chill in one to three locations tops. 

For instance i went to Paris last year and stayed in the same bnb for 10 days. 

What locations can you suggest non Caribbean where we there is not a lot of travel after arriving? By not a lot a travel I mean a day trip or two is fine but we don’t want to relocate every few days to really see the sites. A train trip once or twice tops over the 12-14 days is fine. 

I have already been to Ireland, France and Iceland. We love food, drinks, new experiences. This could be hiking, nature, history, and alcohol. My fiancé advised he wants to feel “relaxed and not rushing around from site to site”. 

So far we are considering Italy and focusing on 2 or 3 main cities.

East Coast Road Trip w/ Itinerary,"Hi Reddit!

So my girlfriend and I are planning an east coast road trip and we wanted to get some more recommendations on what to do along the way. We're flying into Washington, DC August 3rd and renting a car from there. So far, our itinerary looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**NEED TO PURCHASE:**

* EZ Pass Transponder (for tollbooths) or make sure rental has toll included (fastrak)

* **Other Essentials?**

**DO NOT FORGET:**

* If you take a rental car, be sure to have a copy of the rental agreement and other adequate documents for the rented vehicle.
* AAA  -Automobile insurance is mandatory in Toronto, Ontario. Before entering  Canada, check with your insurance provider to find out what your  current coverage includes. It's good idea to obtain a Canadian  Non-Resident Interprovincial Motor Vehicle Insurance Liability Card from  your insurance company, which is free.
* Once you decide your route, check the [border wait time](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html) for  your chosen border crossing in advance. This may save your travel time.  Also, to save wait-time at border, avoid travelling during peak periods

Argentina Trip in December/January,"Hola! My girlfriend and I are planning to travel to Argentina after our wedding in mid-December this year. We have around 22 days and intend to cover the following: 

* Buenos Aires – 4 days 
* Iguazu – 2 days 
* Mendoza – 4 days 
* El Calafate and El Chaltén (for Perito Moreno and Fitz Roy) – 5 days 
* Ushuaia (for Tierra Del Fuego) – 3 days 

That leaves us with four additional days, and we wanted some inputs on which places are recommended (we are not sure about Bariloche, Península Valdés and Torres Del Paine). We’re nature lovers and are excited to explore what Argentina has to offer! As this is our honeymoon kinda trip, we are not really looking at doing long multiple day treks (but we’re looking forward to short one-day treks). We are also not comfortable driving around. 

Would be great if you could give us inputs on: 

1. Broad itinerary covered above, and additional places which we should include.
2. Iguazu – whether we should also cover the Brazil side?
3. Whether 5 days is enough for El Calafate and El Chaltén?
4. I'm guessing we have to take flights for each place. What order should we cover the places in?

Look forward to hear from you guys. Many thanks in advance!",travel

What is your weirdest travel story?,"I'll start with mine.  A few years ago I was travelling NZ solo and I had seen a flyer in our hostel for a one-man show taking place in a performance space not too far away.  I assume there wouldn't be any tickets left over, but I didn't have any other plans for that night, so I wandered over and asked the woman handing out programs if there were any available.  She frowned for a moment and said no, it was all sold out, then paused and said, ""You know what?  This is my dad's show, and I know he wants as many people to see it as possible, so just wait until everyone is seated and I'll bring you a folding chair so you can sit in the back.""  We chatted for a bit and it turned out we had the same first name (Sarah) and we really hit it off.  She was super sweet and kept her word--as soon as everyone was inside, she pulled out a chair and set me up in the back of the room.

Throughout the first half of the show, I kept thinking to myself, ""This actor looks SO familiar"" but I just couldn't place him.  Then, at the intermission, everyone stood up and stretched a bit, at which point I saw that the row in front of me sure had a lot of guys in it that also looked very, very familiar.  It hit me just as the lights dimmed that sitting in front of me was the Kiwi faction of the *The Hobbit* cast and the man on the stage was Mark Hadlow, who played Dori.  After the show, I stuck back a bit to tell Sarah thank you for being so accommodating only for her insist on introducing me to her stepdad (I think she said he was her stepdad?).  I didn't end up taking a picture with him because I was too embarrassed to ask, but I offered to take a picture for one fan and the next thing I knew, I had a line of people handing me their phones. I wound up taking pictures for various strangers for a good 15 minutes before I quietly snuck out and headed back to my hostel.

So that's my weird travel story.  What have you got?",travel

What's it like to rent a car and going out on your own for two Americans knowing no foreign language? If we were to do that, where should we go?",travel
Northern California - Trip Planning &amp; Advice Needed,"I will be in San Francisco for work in October and I am going to extend my trip to explore Northern California. I'm looking for some advice on the best places to go and how long I should extend my trip (I probably won't be able to do more than 5-6 days). I'll be renting a car in SF and I'd like to do a drive to Big Sur (\~3 hours). However, I also want to see the redwoods to the north. There are so many options and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I plan on going to Point Reyes and maybe Muir Woods, as they are closer to the city. But there's also Yosemite, Tahoe, Sequoia NP. I can't narrow it down! I love hiking and primarily am looking to explore lots of different outdoorsy things (hiking, redwoods, coastal spots, etc). I'd also love some recommendations for good campsites or cheap hostels/places to stay. Thanks in advance, I really wish I could do it all!",travel

"Going to Estes Park, CO next week and want to break the trip into two parts. Where else should I spend a few nights?","Hi all, my family (wife and two pre-teen girls) and I have the chance to spend six (maybe seven) nights in the Estes Park area next week. We want to spend three nights in Estes Park (exploring RMNP and hiking) and spend three nights in another town. 

We’re looking for beautiful scenery, charming towns and relaxing days but don’t want to drive too far as we’ll fly in/out of Denver. So, where should we go?  Breckinridge?  Vail?  Any suggestions of towns and/or your favorite hotels would be appreciated. Nearly any budget is ok.

"Travelling between Granada and Ronda, suggestions?","The wife and I will be spending 2 nights in Granada then 2 nights in Ronda during November and travelling via car.

"Four weeks in Europe. Spain, Italy, and (?)","First time in Europe for my wife and I, flying in/out of Madrid from the USA in September 2020.  Hoping to get by on less than $7k for the both of us for the month (excluding airfare)

With four weeks total, we were thinking that 3 of the 4 following locations would be doable. 1 &amp; 2 are pretty much set in stone, although # of days can be adjusted.

1. Madrid &amp; Barcelona, 1 week
2. Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples), 2 weeks
3. Paris &amp; Amsterdam, 1 week?
4. Greece (Athens, Naxos, Santorini), 1 week?

With one week to spare, would you rather do 3) Paris &amp; Amsterdam or 4) Greece? Or spend more time in Spain/Italy? Or travel at a faster pace and try to see it all?

We enjoy good food, arts, history, and different cultures. We would love to see the Louvre / Anne Frank / Van Gogh museum, but the Parthenon / Greek beaches / Santorini sounds awesome as well.",travel

Beijing layover tours other than Great Wall tour??,"I would much rather go into the city than to the Great Wall during my layover, but all the city tours I'm finding starting early in the morning and only pick up/drop off from a hotel.

What is the best way to increase the chances that me and my girlfriend can sit together on our 9+ hour flight without reserving a seat?,"I found $300 roundtrip tickets (Iberia operated by AA) to Paris last week, and jumped on it! Bought two of them on the spot and couldn't be more excited. Both of us are frugle spenders, and she has never been out of the country so this is perfect!

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to reserve our seats, it costs $100+ to reserve an aisle or window seat, and $60 for a middle seat. I kind of expected that since the flight was so cheap, so we probably will not reserve seats. However since this is her first long flight, we would like to be sitting next to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

If we do not reserve seats, are we able to reserve seats for free when we check into the flight 24hrs in advance on their mobile app? If not, what would give us the best chance to sit next to each other without paying $300+ to reserve our seats? Thanks in advance!",travel
Help finding walking sandals,I ordered 2 pairs of Chaco sandals because I’ve read that they’re incredibly comfortable and I’m going on a month long vacation to Europe where I’ll be walking A LOT.

"Barcelona, Spain or Split, Croatia","I’m looking to take a week-long solo trip and stay in a hostel in Barcelona, Spain or Split Croatia either before Summer or after Summer (year 2020). Here's what I’m looking for during this time:

\-Beautiful beaches

\-Expansive nightlife – I like to party

\-Ability to connect and befriend other travelers or locals

The decision has been tough. I’ve conducted research through articles, imagery, and videos and have formalized my own personal opinions:

Please note that I am not stating that these facts are true, but based on articles I’ve read and photos I’ve seen, Barcelona has more social options, as in, more expansive nightlife and more opportunities to socialize and befriend others, however, the Country is not as beautiful as Croatia. I feel that Croatia’s beaches and architecture are absolutely stunning in comparison to Spain, but I’m afraid Croatia will have more “dead seasons” during the time frame I’m looking to go and I won’t be able to connect or socialize as much as I would if I was in Spain. 

Any opinions from those that have visited the two destinations?",travel

1 Weekend trip to Seattle or Portland?,"Hey, I’m a 22-year-old guy planning to fly through the States from the 13th to the 30th of September and got most of my trip planned already. I am there to visit some Online Friends and to attend a Convention, if possible I of course want to do a bit of sightseeing etc... but I am mostly there to have a good time with Friends I don’t see very often (some even for the first time).

I will arrive in New York spend the weekend there, continue on to San Francisco and spend most of the week there, then I will continue flying up to Seattle/Portland spending the weekend in one of those city and after that fly back to LA where I will stay the week until towards the end of the week where I will take a Bus down to San Diego for the Convention. After that I will take a plane directly back to NY and from there another Plane back to Germany. (I have been in America before but both times I only stayed within the LA county.)

The only thing I haven’t figured out yet is which City to visit in Oregon/Washington. One of my friends wants to meet up with me to show me one of the 2 above mentioned Cities. She has been in both before and said that I would love either but she wants me to decide in which one we should meet up. We only have 3 days (1 weekend) up there so visiting both Cities wouldn’t do either one justice.

I absolutely love the vibe of the west coast in general, especially in Fall. I always wanted to see Seattle and Washington State, on the other hand my Friend told me that Portland has tons of awesome food trucks and I love the American food culture. I’ve read up on both Cities and yeah, they both sound amazing. So both have a lot going for them and it’s just super hard for me to decide.

So I wanted to ask you for your opinion. Which City would you visit in my Place? And of course, if you have any other travel advice for the various locations I am going to visit feel free to share them with me.",travel

Russia has banned road and rail entry via Belarus which is annoying as I’ve heard the train from Poland to Moscow is great.  
We aren’t super wealthy either so maximum budget for travel would be around £250 each total (that means to get that and to get back would need to be total £500 for the 2 of us).
