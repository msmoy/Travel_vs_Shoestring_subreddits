Safe way to knock myself out on a flight...,"So, I have a flight coming up - not too long, but it’s an overnight flight and I want to sleep, even if it isn’t just for a couple of hours.

"Can I stay in Tokyo, Japan but still go to all the major places in Japan?","Hello,
I am going to Japan for a 6 night trip. I am staying in Tokyo, Japan for the whole trip. However, I am wondering if it feasible to see every major city in Japan leaving and returning to Tokyo every day. I was going to buy the JR pass and just go to one major place a day, spend the day there, and return at night. If anyone has any insight into this that would be amazing.

Dubai Liquor Laws,"Hey just a question about Dubai as i haven't done much traveling and i'm not too sure how to research this, i'm not staying in Dubai its just a stop over between Australia and Switzerland. basically i have heard stories of people getting arrested for being drunk in public and i'm not sure what this means as the article doesn't really go into detail. Basically if i drink on a flight would i get in trouble in Dubai for being drunk in a public place? also as i'm 20 i'm allowed to drink in Australia but not Dubai how would that work?

Bringing back 10 Liters of liquor from China to US,"This is my first post btw:

So I am in China for a summer internship right now and I come back to the US in a few days.  I was in a grocery store near where I was staying and I saw they had 5 Liter plastic jugs of 62% Baijiu.  They were 12 dollars each so I picked up 2 jugs to bring back to the US. (One for me and one for my friends)

I did some research and kept seeing about a 5L limit for bringing in liquor to the US and was wondering if I can only bring one of the jugs back or if I can bring both back?  Thanks",travel
Is travelling with a study visa out of Italy while carrying a receipt for the Permesso di Soggiorno appointment at the Questura okay?,"Hello helpful people!


I am a Canadian conducting research (excavation) in Italy with a Visa (Studio Post-Laurea) valid as of June 30th. In applying for the visa, my PhD supervisor provided a letter of permission indicating I would be excavating in July, leaving Italy to do research in Athens for August, and returning to Italy as a visiting scholar at an Italian university September-December. This was approved. 



I've just submitted my Permesso Di Soggiorno and my appointment at the Questura is in September. My fear is that, with only the receipt for the future appointment, I may not be permitted to leave the country until I receive the official residency card. While online research tells me this is permitted for a permisso for lavoro, I can't find any official confirmation that this is the same for permesso for studio. 


Obviously my funds are tied up in this study period in Greece and not being permitted to leave requires that I find somewhere new to stay in Italy. 


Any help that anyone could provide that would convince me (and my supervisor) that I am okay to travel would be greatly appreciated! Grazie mille!",travel

Dubai - interesting notes,"1. Fines

Payments for fines are usually written on warnings. It is useful. 1 AED = 0,5$. Driving through a red light will cost 30k$ if you are bump into a tram.

We have been learning their rules before our trip especially about clothes. You should have covered shoulders and knees. But in fact, a lot of people break rules. When you leave a beach security guard will ask you to wear your clothes.

2) Month of Ramadan

Muslims don't eat from dawn to dusk in this month. It means that nobody can eat something on the streets in the daytime. Windows of cafes and restaurants are closed in the daytime. We bought ice cream and wanted to eat it under the sun but it was prohibited. I understand that it helps Muslims but I saw a billboard with a sandwich. Even ice cream carts are covered but the billboard is allowed.

3) Advertisement

There is a little amount of advertisement in the streets. Most of them are shop signs. There are a few billboards. It makes the city looks better. I noticed that prostitutes advertise themselves by business cards on pavements in the streets.

4) Porn

It is prohibited and blocked here. I can't watch. It is said that fine for this is from 1m$ to 1 year in prison. But one local man said that it is hooey.

5) Uber

It is nonsense but Uber is more expensive than the ordinary state taxi. It comes to the hotel for 1-2 minutes and cheaper for 20-30%. One ride costs 7$.

6) Parking

There are few places for parking in the streets but nobody breaks the rules. They have a high penalty for this and confiscation car. You should have a clear car even you leave in parking and go on holidays.

7) Tube

There is an underground railway carriage exclusively for women and children.

8) Coins

Unexpectedly in the Arabian country, there are no Arabic or Roman numerals. I can't guess money value indicated on coins there.

Help planning Central/Northern Europe Itinerary with 6 mo. baby,"Hi. My wife and I are both able to spend \~17 days in Europe starting the end of this month. We have booked a flight into Zurich and out of Oslo. We have done most all big cities in Europe, although we only spent about 2 days in each. Because of this, I'd like to see some of Scandanavia as well as nature and smaller cities. We also think it would be a good idea to be in cities where it is easy for us to put the baby down for a nap, then take nice walks when he is up.  


We have already done a quick trip through Switzerland that included Interlaken and Lucerne, but are open to spending more time there since it is so nice!

\-Rent AirBNBs with A/C and Washer/Dryer  
\-Limit ourselves to 3 or 4 cities

Peru hostel/tour booking before your trip or when you arrive?,"For those who have booked hostels and tours in Peru; did you find it best to book when you were planning your trip around a month in advance, or was booking within a few nights of your stay best?  


Normally for my past vacations I pre-plan and book everything well in advance. However I've been seeing evidence that Peru often works best with finding and paying for things when you arrive and are close to the date of the stay/experience. Thoughts?

Help choosing next trip. Christmas trip!,"Hi, on my last trip, the airline arrived 4 hours late and now I'm going to be rewarded with 400 euros. 

My girlfriend and I, thought we would take advantage of them traveling far away, outside Europe, and our main ideas were either travelling to the United States or travelling to Canada. We want to do it on christmas time as that will be when we have the most time free, from 22 Dec until 5 Jan.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know where should we go, we would like to have a vacation that is not too busy and stressful, with time to explore the city (especially art museums, we both study art), go to a play or a movie, celebrate Christmas together eating out or going out to grab some drinks. We dont like typical ""touring"".

We really like the underground environment, we feel very attracted to Hip-Hop music so if there is a concert we would love to go there. We do not want to go shopping and spend all our money, although we would love to make a special purchase somewhere unique. 

We love doing activities on the city (plays, concerts, riding...), if there are, of course. We aren't night owls, but we like to spend some nights exploring the nightlife. 

A point in favor would be the legalization, I'd like to have a bit of weed for two weeks. But this isn't the most important thing

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know some options of your choice, and if its possible why you choosed that. If you choose a state, please tell me which cities of that state would suit the most.

Taiwan Itinerary Check!,"Hi guys, 

My girlfriend and I are heading to Taiwan at the start of Jan next year for 11 days. Currently this is our plan.

\- Hualien Day 6-10  
\- Taipei Day 11

However, I'm having some mix feelings about kenting because I've been reading around and its seems like a tourist trap with not much to do and it also seems like its horribly hard to get to hualien to kenting.

Scotland &amp; Ireland in two weeks (end of September to October) ?,"Hi,

Me and my friend are planning a trip to Scotland and Ireland from the end of September to mid October.

I am aware it is getting quite cold during that time but I figured that if we start at Scotland we will be evading the weather as it gets colder and colder (fingers crossed).

Our budget is not really limited (though we are not planning to stay in hotels ,more like hostels / motels if thats possible)

We do want to rent a car throughout the entire period or whatever time necessary .

We really love country-side scenery, castles,  whisky  - especially the Islay ones and Puffins :D, and we also really love Guinness

First Solo Trip Advice: 15 Days in Spain &amp; Paris,"I'm currently planning my first solo trip to Spain and France in November. It'll be my first real international solo trip (the US doesn't feel like it counts as someone from Canada), while also being my second trip to Europe. This'll also be my first time staying in mostly hostels, for economic and social reasons. I tend to prefer to stick to myself on solo trips when in the US but I feel I need this change of pace to open up a bit. &gt;!My Raptors also lost Kawhi and I need to not think about basketball this Fall.!&lt;  I'm personally interested in experiencing/seeing architecture, a new different culture, and history, with some good photographic opportunities. I also really enjoy alcohol, but don't intend to get party-drunk, more social drinking for this trip.

I've currently budgeted at least $2000 CAD for accomodations (flight(s) + hostels + rail pass), and right now I'm estimated to be around $1800 if my math is correct. I've already shortlisted some hostels/airbnbs for each city, many of which come from recommendations based on this sub and HostelWorld. I plan on booking everything end of this week or this weekend, ideally. I would also have around $2000 CAD to play with for food, day trips, and amenities. 

Based on research and insight provided by this sub, the solo travel sub, and from friends, I drew up this interim itinerary. Paris takes up the second leg of my trip due to it being cheaper to catch a return flight back home to Toronto, for some reason. However, I'd like some critique on what I've laid out so far. 

* Day 1: Toronto &gt; Madrid
* Day 2: Madrid - Segovia Day Trip
* Day 3: Madrid &gt; Seville (Train)
* Day 3: Seville - Cordoba Day Trip
* Day 4: Seville
* Day 5: Seville &gt; Granada (Train)
* Day 6: Granada - Alhambra
* Day 7: Granada flight to Barcelona
* Day 8: Barcelona - Montserrat Day Trip
* Day 9: Barcelona (Thinking about Giron Day Trip?)
* Day 10: Barcelona &gt; Paris (by Train)
 * Explore Montmartre Area (I plan on staying in this area!)
* Day 11: Paris - Walk along Seine River 
 * Arc de Triomphe &gt; Eiffel Tower &gt; Seine River &gt; Notre Dame (;_;) &gt; Latin Quarter
* Day 12: Paris - Louvre &gt; Latin Quarter again lol
* Day 13: Paris - Army Museum &amp; Napoleon's Tomb
* Day 14: Paris - Versaille
* Day 15: Paris flight back to Toronto

I just wanted to grab a second opinion on how I'm allocating my days and time, considering my transportation options and amount of days. I've messed around with the idea of going directly to Seville upon arriving to Madrid, and then going Seville &gt; Granada &gt; Madrid (1.5 days 2 nights) &gt; Barcelona instead, to take advantage of the railpass instead of flying out of Granada. But I'd like a second opinion on that idea. I've dug up train schedules for this month and next, and I'm kind of just assuming it will be similar come November. 

I was also wondering if any of my day trip choices are valid in the interest of time. I've done my research and found they tend to be within an hour or a bit more to do day trips from their respective cities, but again, second guessing myself etc etc. I am worried about burning myself out so I'm just listing ideas, but whatever happens happens. I am used to the constant hustle and long days, but I am sort of hoping the spirit of adventure keeps me alive.

Thanks in advance for the advice/help!",travel
How to travel by Train from Nijmegen (NL) to Belluno (IT),"Hii all!

I was planning to go on vacation with 3 good friends of mine to go camping in Belluno Italy. We had in mind to buy plane tickets but were too late with buying tickets so right now they go over the counter for a price of 330 euro which we think is a LOT. We considered traveling by car but since we dont own a car ourselves and I'm the only one with a license it didn't seem like a real good fit. 

""Why not by train?"" we thought, well since there are 3 borders that we have to cross it seems like a though solution since we only know how the train works in NL. I want to figure out how this works by gathering information and i thought this subreddit might have some people willing to help out with some tips on how to arrange a travel like that.

I goofed up on my ESTA application,"Hello all. UK Citizen here.

I posted previously about my trip to LA being arranged for a couple weeks time (flights and hotel booked already) My ESTA was deemed unauthorised for travel and at first I was thinking it was because I am self employed which was strange as I've been approved for like 4/5 ESTAs in the past with zero issues and I am squeaky clean when it comes to records/health etc.

After further review I realised under the eligibility questions that no sane person would answer yes to (don't ask how I did it) I answered 'yes' to having a physical/mental disorder/being a drug abuser having Ebola/Smallpox/Yellow Fever etc which was a huge L on my part.

Phoning the Embassy was a bit of a myth as the operator just cut me off and sent me an unhelpful recorded message.

As I'm sure this isn't the first time that this has happened, am I able to reapply after 72 hours and change that question and get approved? Or will I still need to apply for a tourist visa?

Mexico City Airport security query,"Hello all, I hope this question that’s a bit left of centre is ok to post here in the hopes that someone can give some advice! 

I’m an Australian musician performing on a tour through Mexico and on my way through Benito Juarez airport travelling CDMX &gt; Tijuana I had an issue with security (not customs) confiscating a piece of musical equipment with no explanation as to why other than ‘you can’t have this’ (FYI, it was a drum pedal that I’ve travelled with for many years with no issues). 

As it’s a quite pricey piece of equipment ($600AUD  to replace) I filed a claim with my travel insurance company. It was denied on the basis that there is no coverage for anything confiscated by ‘the government’. Now I know that airport security is handled by external contractors in many countries rather than a government agency.

We're thinking of spending 3 days in Milan, and about 3 days near Nice at the end of the trip.

I'm wondering what would be the best way to spend 4 days ""making our way"" from Milan to Nice; rent a car, pick a ""base"" between both cities, and go on day trips? If so, what are some interesting options?  

I tried searching for similar posts, but couldn't find any. Please let me know of any additional details you may need to facilitate discussions :-)

Thank you very much in advance!",travel
Road trip Ukraine to Italy,"Hi everyone!
I am planning a road trip from Ukraine (Ternopil) to Italy (Florence). I’m driving with two of my friends and this will be my first time driving through countries in Europe. I also live in the States but going to visit family in Ukraine and set 6 days aside to go on this road trip. I wanted to ask if anyone had made a similar drive before and had some advice? Should I book hostels ahead of time or can I wing it? (I have never stayed in a hostel). Any must see spots along the way? Any feedback would be appreciated. 
I’ll be driving through
-Poland
-Hungary
-Slovenia 
Coming back 
-Austria
-Czechia 
-Slovakia 

And obviously I’ll be in Florence so any hidden gems I should check out?",travel
First time travelling! (Europe) Need help !!!,"Hi guys, for the first time in my life, I am finally travelling. However, I have few things I'm anxious about. I realized that Europe has a different voltage than what we have here in Canada. I don't like going out with wet hair so I need to bring hair dryer and since my hair is frizzy, I use iron to straighten my hair. The problem is I am not sure if what I have will work in Europe.

My flat iron:

125/250 AC   50/60Hz   30W

My hair dryer:

125/250 AC   60Hz   1600W

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. My hair dryer has a switch. When I switch it upwards, it is very low and when I switch it downwards, it is very high and dries my hair faster. Sorry, it has no labels on the switch area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will these work in Europe?

Thanks in advance!",travel

We (38m, 34f, 6f) are traveling to Chicago in August. Sunday-Friday. We plan on getting the city pass to do the major museums and skydecks.

First Impressions of South Korea (Solo),"I thought I would write this up from the perspective of someone who just arrived a few days ago. I usually see things from people who spent months, but they normally forget the small things. Here's my impression so far and thoughts for other travelers.

1. Learn to read Hangul. The trains and buses are fabulous, but the 'foreigner boards' are not always turned on/working. This makes finding your stop fun as you have to squint at the tracks on approach. Being able to sound out the words makes a big difference. Also, the tmoney card is great for the trains. I bought one in the station - note that it does not come with money on it. You have to take out the card and load money (usually cash) into it using any of the transit machines. Most trips cost 1200 krw (~$1). I personally did not use the tmoney card at convenience stores since I have a chase travel card that waives transaction fees.

2. Many people don't speak English. You don't have to be fluent in Korean. Know how to count in Chinese and Korean. Know how to ask for prices. How to ask where things are. Know how to say thank you and 'please give'. Those are the phrases I use the most and it gets me most of the way.

3. Download Naver Maps. Google Maps does not work in SK, so you're stuck with Naver. It's.. okay. You have to constantly look at it to keep track of where you are. Also, Seoul is huuuuuge. Make sure you give yourself time going district to district. Even on the train it can take over an hour to get from hongik to Gangnam.

4. You will get stared at, but not for long. I definitely had people stare at me on the train and buses, and most especially at restaurants. But they're not malicious, just curious I guess. 

5. Arrive early at the airport. If you can get a flight that arrives early you're in for a mostly empty airport and about 2 minutes through customs. It was a super lovely experience.

6. Menus are bilingual. Every restaurant, even the obscure ones, have several languages: English, Chinese, Japanese.

7. If you're a foreigner, you will have people barrage you for taxis, clothes, makeup, etc. I'm a white female so I don't know if this applies to everyone, but I felt targeted at every shopping district. They definitely thought I needed a taxi everywhere I went. So just be aware.

8. Subways are a bit crazy sometimes. If you get on the wrong train by accident, you're probably going to have to walk a half mile to get to the other side of the tracks. Most of the subway stops don't meet in the middle so it's inconvenient as hell. I've walked a metric ton in the past two days. Also, the trains have designated seats for elders and pregnant women. Just keep an eye out for those sections. I've almost sat in those seats by accident.

9. Bring water with you (summer). It is quite warm, and if you're visiting popular tourist places, they do not sell water inside. You should stop at a convenience store and grab water before going in. I almost died of thirst at the palace.

10. Be careful of guesthouses. I got a room in a guesthouse that had good reviews, but when I arrived they said the A/C was broken and they couldn't fix it. So I said screw it and got an expensive hotel (yes it's that hot). The hotels aren't terribly pricey compared to huge cities like New York or Tokyo.

11. Gangnam is pretty boring. I walked around the area for half the day today and it's just a posh area with not much to do besides go to spas. Hongik Station/Hongdae is fascinating. Although if you're over 35 it might not be your scene. Tons of younger, college kids.

12. Restaurants tend to serve meals for 2+ people. As a solo traveler, it was hard to get small portions at restaurants. The food was always really good, but I have yet to clear a plate.

13. Get the cold soup. I had it at a restaurant and from a street vendor. Delicious and refreshing both times in the boiling sun. Also, I thought I hated kimchi. No, I hate American Kimchi. The pickled vegetables have been insanely good at all restaurants.

14. You need to find an ATM with 'Global' banking allowed. There are atm's everywhere, but they don't allow foreign transactions. And if they do, they limit it to 100,000krw (~85usd). I tried five or six atm's before stumbling upon ibk bank. They have a Max of 800,000 krw, and I finally withdrew cash.

15. The most shocking thing is how uh.. rude? old people are. Not all of them, but I've been shoved aside by a few grannies on the train. Everyone else is nice, but I think it's part of the 'respect elders' thing. Just let them go first and avoid an elbow in the back.",travel
"Looking for help. AA cancelled flight and can't get us home for 2 extra days, but won't recognize flights with other airlines?","So I'm not sure if this is an appropriate subreddit but since so many people travel a lot I thought ya'll may have experience with this situation and how to handle American Airlines customer service.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our AA flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. We'd even go to San Antonio or Houston and drive home if we could get back today.

&amp;#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. 

M: ""How about tomorrow?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

M: ""Why is ours the only one cancelled?""

AA: ""Because of weather. "" 

M: ""Then why are all the other flights still going and why can't I find anything online about DFW being closed?"" 

AA: ""Well because of the weather we don't have a crew for your flight.""

&amp;#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" 

AA: ""Nothing until Tuesday."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&amp;#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (Monday - why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&amp;#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&amp;#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

AAG: ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" 

M: ""No."" 

AAG: ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" 

M: ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" 

AAG: ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. The Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets but, magically, the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&amp;#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone with - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck and run for cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too if we drop American so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

"Help with itinerary! Yucatan, Mexico","Hi everyone,

I'm planning my first trip to Yucatan, Mexico (solo) - I plan to be there for 9 days from July 12-21. 

Here's my itinerary so far - would love any feedback and tips! I'll be staying in hostels, and not sure yet if I'll be renting a car or taking the bus (open to suggestions!)

* Jul 12 - Arrive in Cancun @ 12pm, drive/bus to Merida

* Jul 13 - Uxmal in the morning, back to Merida for the afternoon/evening

* Jul 14 - Depart Merida, Izamal in the morning, Chichen Itza in the afternoon, arrive in Valladolid (should I just skip Izamal so that I can check out Chichen Itza super early before everyone arrives?)

* Jul 15 - Depart Valladolid, Ek Balam in the morning, Coba ruins in the afternoon, arrive in Tulum in the evening

* Jul 16 - Tulum - beaches, maybe Sian Ka'an

* Jul 17 - Depart Tulum in the morning, arrive in Isla Holbox in the afternoon

* Jul 18 - Isla Holbox (beach, relaxation, slower non-touristy pace)

* Jul 19 - Depart Isla Holbox, arrive in Isla Mujeres

* Jul 20 - Isla Mujeres (beach, relaxation, a bit more upbeat/nightlife)

* Jul 21 - Depart Isla Mujeres for Cancun Airport

I'd visit various cenotes in and around the areas as well, just haven't figured out which ones and when yet. 


**Questions/comments:**

* Is this itinerary too much? Should I take one spot out, so I can extend my stay in other places? 

* Are all these places doable by bus? Or is a rental car required?

* Ideally I'd love to check out Cozumel and the Las Coloradas as well, but I don't think I'll have time. Or should I go to Cozumel instead of Isla Mujeres?

* An alternative route would be to do this in reverse, i.e. Cancun -&gt; Tulum -&gt; Valladolid -&gt; Merida -&gt; Holbox -&gt; Mujeres -&gt; Cancun. Would that be a more logical route?",travel

Itinerary review: two weeks in the northeast US during the Summer.,"Hi all, this is an update to the question posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/c8x8y0/two_weeks_on_nyc_or_1_week_roadtrip_from_nyc_and/).

I'll be traveling from July 25th to August 10th, flying in and out of EWR airport near New York City.

I'll already be in Philadelphia for work on the 25th. Then my girlfriend will arrive from EWR and will take a train to meet me in Philly.

July 26th -&gt; See Philadelphia.

July 27th -&gt; Leave to Washignton DC, lunch in Baltimore, sleep in DC.

July 28th -&gt; DC

July 29th -&gt; DC

July 30th -&gt; Leave DC early morning and take a road trip to Atlantic City through Delaware (and the ferry between Delaware and the NJ coast). Stopping where we might please (maybe see a little bit of countryside Virginia?). Sleep in Atlantic City.

July 31st -&gt; See Atlantic City, go to Philly by the afternoon, drop the rented car and take a night train to Boston. Sleep on the train.

Spain itinerary help for mobility limitation,"We are flying into Barcelona in October and at this point are planning our cities and lodging and could use some advice for our particular circumstances.

Greece in June or September?,"Hello everyone! 

I’m planning my next adventure! I would like to visit Greece for 3 weeks (Athens, Sifnos, Naxos, and Milos) in 2020, but am having a hard time choosing between visiting in June or September. 

From my understanding, neither are during the peak season (July, August). June will be warmer (I have read it can get up to 100° F, but read it will be generally cooler). The water will be warmer in September, and the temperature will be cooler (80° F). I have read that both months can have peak prices despite not being during peak season. Supposedly, some islands are “prettier” in June because not everything has baked in the sun all summer. However, school gets out in the middle of June which means there could be more people than in September?

Ideally, I would prefer to go in June, though I do plan on being out in the sun hiking and exploring most of the trip, so it is important it isn’t scorching (I am from Nor-Cal where it is frequently 100° F+ during the summer so I am used to it, though it is awful). 

Does anyone have experience going in either of these months regarding weather, ocean temperature, crowds, and prices? Any input about anything would be of great help!

I need help with an ESTA Application with a dual-citizenship,"maybe you guys can help me. I am a uk citizen with a uk passport, who was born in Poland. What I have find out a few weeks ago, is that I still have the polish citizenship (you can't really lose it until you declare it)

I have visited the US three times before and every time I have filled out my esta, I have said, that I don't have any other citizenship except the uk one. (Which I always thought is true, since I don't have any other passport)

I never had any problems entering the us. Now, that I know that I still have the polish citizenship, I don't know what to do. If I say yes, could there be any problems, since the officers can accuse me of lying on my other applications?

But I can't say No either, right? Or can I since I don't have any other passport except the UK one.

Every help is much appriacted.",travel
Do you avoid looking up your destination before going?,"I'm closing in on my first international trip and although I have a bit of an obsessive personality, I'm actively avoiding watching videos or seeing too many pictures of my destination because I want the experience to feel new and be (somewhat) of a surprise to me.

I dont leave everything up to mystery, however. I definitely check out my AirBNBs and Hostels to make sure they look comfortable and appealing, I find out what the key things to do around the area are, but I stop there. 

There are so many great vlogs and similar videos on youtube and elsewhere that I could easily take a tour of my destination right from my couch, but I purposely avoid these even though I'm tempted beyond belief to watch them. Instead, I allow myself to obsess over airplane videos. I've flown a lot so I'm not spoiling anything there and finding out about an airplane's secrets is a cool place to take my mind while I'm on my next flight",travel

Trying To Finalize Trip To Greece &amp; Israel with my GF - 14 Days,"Hi Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to finalize a trip to Greece &amp; Israel. My main concern with this itinerary is that we may be doing too much with the flight to Tel-Aviv

&amp;#x200B;

**Rough Itinerary:**

\- Fly into Chania, Crete (2 Nights)

Flying into Chania where we'll be meeting my girlfriend's cousin who's stationed out on Crete (She's in the Navy). 

\- Rethymo (1 Night)

Staying a night in Rhythmo so we can take the ferry to Santorini in the morning. 

\- Rethymo --&gt; Santorini (3 Nights)

We may stay in Thira for all three nights but I'm not 100% on which locations will be the best. This looks like the most relaxing part of the trip as we won't be bouncing around from island to island or have to move luggage or check in/out of a hotel for a few days

\- Santorini --&gt; Crete, Malia (2 Nights in Malia)

We're going back to Crete (which I'm not the most excited about) due to my girlfriends cousin being stationed over in Malia. We're going to spend some time with her, though I feel there might be other island's I could hop to as opposed to going to Malia for a few nights? Not sure

\- Heraklion --&gt; Tel Aviv (1 Night) 

Flights into Tel Aviv we're the cheapest and had the best times. We thought of doing Israel due to the flights being so inexpensive but taking another flight after getting from the US to Greece seems like it might be a little too much, logistics wise. I don't think my girlfriend is considering just how many logistical situations going to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem may add. We're going to check out the night life and the ocean for a bit but one night seems to short change Tel Aviv. 

\- Tel Aviv &gt; Jerusalem (2 nights)

We're going to see the dead see as well as some other historical sights around Jerusalem but nothing is finalized as far as bus tours or day trips

\- Jerusalem &gt; Tel Aviv (1 Night)

Back to Tel Aviv as we need to fly out of Tel Aviv to catch the best flight to athens. Though, currently that flight leaves at 6:30am, which doesn't sound reasonable for an international flight back to Greece.

\- Tel Aviv &gt; Athens (2 Nights) - Fly out of Athens

Check out a few sights in Athens, then we fly back to the United states. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips or recommendations on if this is too much or if there may be a better way to plan this trip? I just did a trip from the US to Thailand and Bali in the same trip and going from Bangkok to Bali was too much, IMO. There wasn't enough time to appreciate either culture or country as much as I would have liked to. My concern is throwing a flight in the middle of our Greece trip might short change Israel AND Greece. Also, adding two flights in the middle of the trip may be more stress than seeking out the adventure in Israel. Thoughts, tips, suggestions?

"Planning to travel USA in 2020, need your help with campsites!","Hey guys!

Me and my friends are planning to travel from Boston to Miami in the summer of 2020. We will hire a car to travel from Boston to New York. Once we've visited NY we are planning to pick up a RV to travel from NY to Miami. We did a similar thing last october on trough California. The diffrence between this journey and our previous one is that this one will be in peak season (summer holiday). We can't go outside of this period because we all have school / work to worry about. So my question for you guys is about campsites. In our previous USA trip we didnt plan any campsites beforehand, we just showed up at the sites. Because it wasnt peak season we never had a campsite with no free spaces for the night. Do any of you have experience with traveling witn a RV on the east-coast of the USA and the campsites. Do you guys recon we will have to book the campsites before we go, or that we can show up at a campsite and there are still spaces left. How busy are campsites on the east side of the USA during the month of august.

I hope you guys can help us and can understand my story :P",travel
Thailand visa exemption (UK citizen) questions,"Apologies if this question has already been asked, I've looked around on google and couldn't seem to find quite the answers I was looking for! I'm hoping that someone that as been to Thailand recently will be able to clear this up for me.

So basically, I have my return flights to/from Bangkok booked, I'm a UK citizen so as I understand it, I can stay for 30 days without a visa ([visa exemption](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand/changes-visa-exempt.php)) but I'll need proof of funds 10,000 THB. Does the 10,000 THB need to be in THB or can it be any currency as long as it's equivalent to 10,000 THB? Also, I plan to also travel out of Thailand to Cambodia and Vietnam, but obviously have to return to Bangkok at the end of my trip to catch my return flight to the UK will I need to do the visa exemption process again and show proof of funds again? I don't really fancy carrying around 10,000 THB for my whole trip just to have to convert it back to £ when I get home!",travel
Advice: 17 day itinerary in Spain (and a little of Morocco),"Hi all, my two friends and I are headed to Spain/Morocco in mid August. This is our first time putting together a Europe trip together so we'd love advice. Here's our tentative itinerary:

Land in Madrid around noon  and leave directly for Seville

→ Tarifa (1 night) 

→ Tangier (1 night) 

→  Chefchaouen (1 night)

→ Tangier →  Tarifa → Malaga (2 nights) 

→  Granada (2 nights) 

→ Valencia (2 nights) 

→  Barcelona (2 nights) 

→ Madrid (3 nights)

ADVICE: travelling to america with my family - immigration,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice to (hopefully) put my and my SO's mind at ease. We're UK based and are travelling to the states with our 1yr old for the first time this August for a holiday.

We went to Canada maybe 4yrs ago where I was held up at immigration. Backstory: In my teens, having never left the country, and being completely naive as to the legalities of the condition of a passport - while I was at a festival, I tore a page out of my passport purely because I needed a piece paper (I used it as ID before I got my drivers license). This was the one I used when we went to Canada. Subsequently they pulled me aside for an hour or so to check everything over. (no cavity search).

In the end I think they realised I was simply a dumbass, and allowed me entry with the condition that I get a temporary passport the next day, which we did and all was good.

That passport expired so I have my new - in *immaculate* condition passport - now, but my worry is, I'm thinking this incident is most probably on file somewhere, but most importantly, will it cause me any trouble with immigration when we get to the states? Thanks for any advice on this, really worried they'll see something and put me on the next flight back. Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone! Can't blame a guy for being neurotic about this stuff (and just, in life) when flying all that way, but everything you've said was spot on, greatly appreciated :)",travel
Travelling made me less career driven,"This is something I've wanted to post for a long time.

I'm a 25 year old male. 2 things I care deeply about are:

1. Self improvement/personal development/self growth - Looking after myself now will improve the quality of my life in future.
2. Being determined to make the most money possible

However, over the last few years I've done a **lot** of travelling including visiting Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, The Philippines, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Albania, Macedonia and Turkey. I've also done a lot of research on visiting countries like Nicaragua, Guatemala, Colombia etc. I love travelling to explore different cultures, ways of life, and explore how other people live and go about their ways of life. I love the authentic non-touristic route and have met some amazing, genuinely lovely people from many developing and third world countries.

One thing I've found is that these people are extremely happy with their life that many of us here would find very basic. They often come from small villages with a simple way of life but a big community atmosphere and spirit within society.

Now back in the UK I've been brought up by my parents to get a good education, work extremely hard through school/college and then continue to work hard in my career now that I'm working full time. However I've realised I prefer to ""work to live"" as opposed to ""live to work"".

In a capitalist world we live in whereby I've been pushed hard by my family that a ""successful"" life is one that involves a good education, lots of money and a well paying job. I feel a bit like a 'letdown' to my parents for saying this but I've also thought to myself that I could happily live in one of these countries I listed above with very limited resources, internet etc and have a very happy life. Perhaps even more happy than in my existing job. I'm in 2 minds whether I continue to work hard or simply enjoy a much more simple life that I'd actually find far more fulfilling.

I'm interested in getting others perspectives on this?",travel

traveling the world between expectations and reality,"warning, ridiculously long post aimed at helping a complete stranger, proceed only if you'r like the nicest person on earth or something :)

hi travelers, 

so before i start let me introduce myself, i am 25yo male, graduated 2 years ago, spent my first year after graduation working as an accountant but quit because of some inconveniences in the workplace and the low salary, i then spent my second year mainly studying German language but also doing some gigs for living, i even studied web development and tried to get a job with no luck, so the plan at that point was to study computer science in Germany because i am really into programming but without going into much details the plan didn't work out and here i am back to working as an accountant. 

so obviously since i am here traveling the world has been always one of my biggest dreams but sadly problems do exist, money is just a minor problem compared to the fact that i am holding an Egyptian passport, so basically no one trusts me to go abroad and then go back to the shithole i came from, which is something i definitely understand tbh.

so now that you know a little bit about me lemme get started and the way i am going to write this post is in form of questions and answers 

1- why do i want to travel as many countries as i can?

well, first because i am not dying having only seen one place, that's just not going to happen even if i have to cross the  Mediterranean swimming, i'll go for it and at least i will have a good one last adventure, second because you only live once and you gotta make it count and third i am so sick of trying my best to prove to the world that i deserve to live in a better place, the USA lottery, the job seeker visas, the point based immigration program, its all so stressing and just feels like people are being selected out of other millions to survive a sinking ship before it takes them way too deep, the whole thing is just so pathetic if you think about it, i just want to be careless for a while, i want to meet people who are not so stressed by work and life.

2- what do i have? what can i do?

A - i am good with Adobe photoshop and illustrator and i have a very acceptable design skills

C - i studied web development 

d - i know German (i can talk about basic stuff, no complex subjects, no politics or international crisis discussions :) )

e - i cant translate from Arabic to English, not so professionally tho and i really doubt anyone could ever pay me to do that

f- i am an accountant so obviously i do accounting stuff

g - i have around 7200 USD (1 EGP is equal to 16 USD and the average salary is 2500 EGP so...)

h - i can do anything an ""average"" person with no disabilities can do ( nothing that requires considerable physical strength for example) 

3- what are the problems ?

lemme see, there is money, as i only have small amount of money to start with so anywhere i go i will have to find a quick way to make money as soon as possible (can i ?), there is also visa problems, i can only travel to 52 countries around the world without visa or at least with visa on arrival, most of these countries are poor hence the free access (except Hong Kong i guess) but it's a good start nevertheless and i am going to take advantage of that, the third problem isn't really specific it's just that life is always throwing reality at you, will i ever be able to support myself traveling from place to place without a steady income ?

4 - so what do i want writing this post anyway ?

advice, maybe some of you guys did that or is doing that ? is it doable? can you travel so many places on budget? is there a skill that i can learn that will make my dream easier to achieve? 

i know about all the ways you find on the internet like staying at someone's house, traveling using public transportation ...etc but i want real people's experience, someone who did that and can tell how to do it and what kind of problems did they face

finally sorry for the long post, just felt like ranting a little, i really appreciate if you made it that far and sorry if my writing is a mess, i am not a gifted writer",travel

I studied abroad in Amman, Jordan from January to May. I'm still in college so it was part of a semester abroad thing. I had an amazing time it was a great experience. For anyone who is studying abroad, if you have the option to stay with a host family, **DO IT!** It's a great way to really get to know the culture, meet new people, and it turns out to be cheaper actually because you aren't playing for food. Plus, you usually get amazing home cooked meals out of it. Amman was very different from what I expected, but I had a great time. There's enough to do in Jordan to keep you occupied, and I highly suggest Wadi Rum, Petra, and Wadi Mujib. It's not the cheapest country, but you can definitely make it budget friendly. Since I was staying with a family and also studying, I don't have an accurate budget of what you'd need. Alcohol is expensive though, and public transportation is virtually non-existent. Cabs and Uber/Careem are the way to go. I felt completely safe as a female, but made sure always to go out at night with people I trusted. For anyone who is wondering, there are bars and clubs :)

&amp;#x200B;

While in Amman I went to Cairo, Beirut, and Cyprus.

* Cairo is very overwhelming as a white, female. I felt perfectly safe but pretty uncomfortable. Seeing the pyramids and Saqarra was phenomenal, and the Egyptian museum was amazing. I probably won't go back for a while, but I'm glad I did.
* I loved Beirut. I stayed with a friend, so she took me to places. The nightlife is amazing, it's right on the sea so pretty good weather. Byblos is really cool, and the people were very friendly. I think I stayed in the most expensive (safest) part of Beirut but it was reeeeally cheap coming from living in Boston. There is a stark contrast between where I stayed and other surrounding towns, and the remnants of the wars are very much there.
* Cyprus was okay. Never been to Greece, but it seems like a tiny Greece without all the major monuments and stuff. Fairly cheap, nightclubs were fun. Not really a beach person but it was nice to relax during spring break. Plus, you can get some really good food. Crossing over to the Turkish side was easy, and fairly uneventful. Not much to see, but a cool experience

&amp;#x200B;

After Amman, I started a two month backpacking trip across Europe. I went solo, with friends, and with family. I went to Hungary, Croatia, Montenegro, Spain, Portugal, and France. This was the first time I've been to all these countries.

* Hungary was amazing. I had such a good time. It's still pretty cheap even with all the backpackers. It's easy to get out of the city to visit smaller towns, and actually you should. Budapest can be done in three days, but it's nice to visit other parts of the country. I enjoyed the food, and highly suggest the free walking tours. I did the general, Jewish quarter, and communism one, and learned sooo much.
* In Croatia I went to Zagreb, Plitvice, Dubrovnik, Split, and Korcula. Zagreb was eh. Plitvice was the highlight of my trip. We went in May so it wasn't too crowded, but I can't imagine what it's like in July/August. Go on some of the back trails and don't just stick to the boardwalks. You can see some pretty amazing waterfalls from up top. I felt Dubrovnik to be pricey and overrated. Too touristy and it's just lost it's culture. I totally get why they do it, but doesn't appeal to me. Could easily be done in a day and a half, and then after that I wish I would have left. It's good place to do some excursions like kayaking, boating, etc, but it was really crowded and just not a lot. Go to War Photo Limited, it's a really cool photo gallery about the war. I much preferred Split and Korcula in Croatia.
* Was in Montenegro for three days and did Kotor, Budva, Mt. Lovcen and a couple hours is Perast. By this time, I was getting tired of old towns, so Kotor wasn't the best, but it's really pretty and walking up the fort wall was cool. I was with my sister who had just flown in so she was pretty tired and jetlagged, but there's a lot of cool nature hikes I would have loved to get to.
* Next was Spain. Since I didn't do this part of the planning, I didn't really know what to expect but I loved Spain. The food was amazing. So much good cheese, tapas, wine, beer, meat, and so much more. Madrid was easy to get around. The Alhambra was absolutely amazing. Book tickets well in advance, and I highly suggest a tour, even as someone who doesn't really like them. My favorite town was Seville. Just a relaxed vibe, and a lot to do. It is true though, the siesta is real as can be. Don't expect dinner until after 8:30, and most attractions don't open until 10. We did some other stops: Toledo, Ciudad Rodrigo, Cordoba, Salamanca. Spain isn't the cheapest place to travel anymore, but you can def do it on a budget. Since I was with my family, we stayed in Airbnb's so not really sure what the hostel prices are.
* Then off to Portugal. Faro, Lisbon, Porto, Aveiro, and then the Dao wine country. Tolls in Portugal are insane. Like 20 euros for one trip kinda insane. If you have the time and don't mind hills, do none toll roads. They are more scenic and  you can find cool things. We found a huge flea market driving back from Aveiro to Madrid. Portugal is cheaper than Spain by a little bit. I liked Spanish food better, but that's not to say Portugal had bad food. Lots of hills in Lisbon. Being on the ocean was nice, which meant really good fish. Lots of tourists, which isn't bad, but get ready if you go dead in the summer. We ended up being there during St Antony's festival which was so fun. Sardines, booze, parades. If you can go in June, they celebrate all their saints I think, and at night there's always something going on. Go to the Resistance Museum, you end up learning a lot about modern Portuguese history and the dictatorship.
* After returning the car, I went to France to meet up with a friend and her family. I did Marseille, Cassis, Aix-En-Provence, and Lyon. Lyon was my favorite. Amazing food, desserts, wine (which I'm not even really a fan of). The craft beer scene has hit, so I liked that. I was there during part of the heat wave, and it was **hot**. Most buildings are old so no AC, so pace yourself if you're there in the heat. France was the most expensive place I visited, but worth it. I was there during the WWC, so there were a lot of watch parties and events which was fun. The WW2 resistance museum was really well done, and learned a lot about Lyon and southern France during the war. I would love to go back to southern France when I have a bit more a budget.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've learned on this trip:

* Learn to say no. It's okay to want to do different things than the people you travel with. I'm one of those people that really can do anything, and will say ""oh I don't care, what do you want to do"", but it's good to have an idea on what you want to see and it's okay to go your separate ways during the day. Don't try to people please, but also don't be a jerk.
* Traveling with family as an older teen/adult is hard. You grow up traveling with them but you don't really plan the trip. Well when you're 21 and aren't shielded from arguments and different opinions it can be rough. I had a great time and am so glad they came to visit, and it worked out, but we haven't done a family vacation in over 10 years and haven't been out of the country together, so it was all new to us again.
* Solo travel is fine. You aren't going to die, you aren't going to go crazy from boredom. You can stay in a hostel to meet people. But honestly, I was okay with solo traveling and being by myself. A lot of times on this sub you read about people who had the best times of their life solo traveling, and meeting new people, and all that. But I was also okay with staying somewhere and just being by myself. I met people and maybe got a drink with them or hung out at the hostel with them, but I learned I much prefer to do the sightseeing by myself or with someone who I know their pace. For example some museums I want to spend three hours in, some I want to spend 30 minutes in. So I prefer to do that with people I know or by myself so i'm not thinking about being down with the other persons schedule. I learned I valued the sightseeing and experiences rather than meeting new people, but that's just me! But I did like meeting people over dinner etc. Just don't get too excited about meeting your bff solo traveling.
* Don't do things just because they are famous. I'm all for going to touristy and famous places, but just because all the sites say to go to the famous art museum doesn't mean you need to. I went to the Prado because it was free for me, but I wouldn't spend the money to go in. But also, don't ***not*** do things because ""everyone else does them."" That's a dumb way to live. Along with this, I grew very tired of paying to go into churches. I think cathedrals and basilicas and all that are insanely pretty and I'm glad I did the big ones, but just because there's one you can go into doesn't mean you need to if it's not your things. And when they take up your budget, it wasn't worth it to me. (Also, why is every church charging like 5 euros to get in? You're getting funded! I'll make the 1 euro donation but jeez).
* Same thing with old towns. The walls are cool, but they were in every town and city in Croatia.
* Transportation in Europe is amazing. Boston has trains that catch on fire. Rip.
* I really liked free walking tours. They gave me the lay of the land, and then I could always circle back after to something that interested me. Especially the theme ones. I tried to do one in every city that had one.
* I also learned I can't do the go out and wander thing. Maybe because it's where I grew up, but not having a set place to get to was not doing it for me. I liked having an end destination and then taking some time walking to that place, but just going out and ""wondering the streets"" (what many people say) I didn't like.
* While doing the long trip was great, I think my next trip will be about 2-3 weeks. I'm glad I tried out the backpacking for two months kinda thing, because it allowed me to learn that I like the shorter 2 week trips.
* Lastly, you have the money you saved for a reason. That's why it was a budget. There were times I didn't want to spend money, but later on realized I could. That budget shouldn't be the money you need to pay your bills. I had savings set aside for the trip, and all my other money was for the things I needed back home. That doesn't mean blow it all, and if you spend less than you budgeted that's great! But it's okay to spend money on tickets and experiences, if that's what you want to do. Not doing something you really want to do because it's $10 is a little ridiculous, at least in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad I went on this trip, and I want to thank this sub for giving me inspirations and suggestions! Happy travels!

Cuba vacation from Toronto,"Hi everyone! 

I apologize in advance if I am not posting in the right subreddit. 
I am just writing to ask for your suggestions for a good resort in Cuba ( we are open about other countries in the Caribbean too! Let's see where this takes us. If it is for other places in the Caribbean I would say our cap is around 1400 CAD) 

It's a couples trip and our budget is no more than $1100pp (I hear that it is not worth it to spend more than that for Cuba) for a week in August.
I really care about the resort being clean, having clean rooms/sheets and it being safe. 
In terms of food, I'd prefer something decent but I am aware Cuba is not like Canada and my expectations are not of 5 star dining. I would like somewhere with fresh food that is good which won't get us sick. 
Also, somewhere that will have some sort of nightlife. My boyfriend and I would also like to party a bit at night/day

A month in Italy in ONE location ! Help me decide.,"So I have travelled a bit of Italy, but far from enough.

My business partner and I will be spending a month in Italy hosting friends and clients.

I like Monterosso, and Amalfi, but we are thinking maybe we're not considering some areas which are deserving.

A beach town
Restaurants/food
Some good night life
Relatively easy to access from an airport.

Looking For Neck/Head Pillow with Strap that is THIN,"Hi guys, I saw another post on this subreddit talking about neck pillow so I'm asking your recommendations.

Friend wants to spend too much on trip,"Hello everyone,

My friend and I have been saying that we want to travel for a while now. We were initially going to visit Vancouver but he springs up with Vegas. Well checked flights and hotels and surprisingly it is actually cheaper! So I said sure let's do Vegas and we decided we'd split the costs of things like travel, accommodation, food...etc. 

Now that we already booked Vegas he wants to rent a fancy sports car and add a bunch of other really expensive things to the trip and I just cannot afford it. He has a REALLY good paying job, like making 10K+ a month is not unusual for him meanwhile I'm going to school and currently seeking part time employment while I finish classes. So it's very easy for him to spend this money. I had originally put a budget cap of $600 for the 4 days, now I'm bumping it up to $1000 after realizing that it won't be nearly as cheap as I thought. But now he's starting to add a lot of things I can't afford to the itinerary and it's stressing me the hell out. 

I want to talk to him and tell him that I can't afford to go overboard but at the same time I don't want to ruin his (and mine) first trip to Vegas by limiting the things he can do and he won't do things without me, so it's not like I can tell him to do more expensive things alone. He keeps talking about ""going all out"" and ""yolo"". I feel like once we get there he's going to suggest very expensive restaurants and events...etc. We have another very cheap friend who's in an even better financial situation than me (who isn't going on this trip for obvious reasons), anyways that friend is always complaining about spending money (even small amounts) and my friend who I'm going with really hates it because he feels like he's being attacked for making good money (in a way, he really is, because that other friend always makes comments like ""Not all of us have money"" and ""Must be nice""...etc). I'm also worried he'll take it that way as well. 

Generally speaking, he's usually pretty level with me when it comes to spending money. By that I mean he doesn't tend to splurge beyond my means (or I should say he's been steadily going up in spending and it's starting to put a strain on me). 

So fine people of reddit, how do I approach this without being offensive and without ruining his trip. 

TL:DR Friend who is way richer than me wants to spend way more than I can afford on trip that was supposed to be cheap.

A Trip to the North of Portugal - any maybe Spain,"Hi everyone,

We are planing a trip to the North of Portugal in August, and have done no planning due to moving a few weeks ago, which turns out to be really stressful!  

&amp;#x200B;

Current Plan:  Fly in Porto, spend three nights (might cut it down to 2 nights), then hit the road.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are thinking - 

1.  Drive to Aveiro - the venice of portugal.  Is that worth visiting?  
2. Head to the Duoro Valley.  Is there anything else you do there besides visiting Vinyards?  What is the etiquette for this.  In the USA we just kind of show up and give us wine.  Same deal?  Any good wine hotels you can recommend?
3. Then ?  
4. Initially we wanted to head to A Coruna in spain, and check out that area.  Is that a feasible drive, or only a few hours?  
5. Then we will end in Bragga before heading back to Porto Airport to catch a flight to Lisboa.  

Any other recommendations for cool stuff to do in the northern spain?  Any food tour opportunities, or just do that in Porto?  

What about beaches?  Anything worth a visit?

Ive been looking into [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FD5MLVB/?coliid=IUJJHLZFBC087&amp;colid=11WNXZQXAKY9K&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)  as I feel packing it would be the easiest for most efficient packing for me but not 100% that it will be okay on all flights as a carry on along with my backpack. The bag is measured 22x11x12 (45L) but is a soft side bag so it can be crunched down and squeezed into areas. It says it meets the requirements to fit in the sizer at the airports but airlines have different sizes (especially international right?). One review said ""*This is the first carry-on garment bag I have been able to use for week-long international travel.*"" But I don't know what international flight that was. One thing also to keep in mind with this bag is to fit my tripod as it wont fit into my backpack. Am I going to be in the clear with this or should I be worried about running into an issue at some point and just find a different bag? If so, what bags would you suggest to prevent any issues from coming up? I cant look up specific flights to check measurements individually as I have no 100% plan for where ill be going as it all will just be whatever happens happens kind of traveling around the world. Thus why I want to just find one from the start that should be okayed regardless of the flight.

&amp;#x200B;

When  it comes to packing: Ive read into several different styles from  Rolling clothes, Vacuum Bags, to packing cubes. Ive seen pros and cons  to all of them. Ive heard from long term travel to not use cubes because  they take up space that can always be used for something else. The  downfall to vacuum bags is that people say the lose air, also how to  remove the air the best. I have looked at ones with pumps that plug into  USB ports for power and ones with the hand pumps to remove air.

&amp;#x200B;

PS.  Ive see some checklists of things to pack X amount of shirts/ pants/ shorts/etc... and was wondering if anyone has some lists as well so I can look at them to compare them all and figure out what would be best for me and give me a rough idea of what I can and cant/ should and shouldn't bring.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  sure ill have more and more questions as time goes on while I get ready  and prepare for my trip around the world in a few months (if everything  goes as planned).

Recommend a week long solo European holiday for 33rd birthday,"I have just arranged a week off work at the end of July, and will have my birthday during that week. I don't have a travel buddy. British female based in London. I have travelled alone many many times, but I am getting a bit tired of it, so want to go somewhere that will have enough activities and things to do to keep me amused.

I'd like to escape somewhere for a week but am struggling to know where to go. I'm on a bit more than a backpacker budget, say £50 a night for accommodation, but this could be a bit flexible. 

* Like - day hikes, kayaking, wine and wine tours/tasting, boutique shopping (or at least window shopping!), museums, warm weather, ocean/lake swimming, cafe culture

* Not fussed by - sports, historical sites and architecture, swimming pools and resorts, sitting on the beach or a sun-lounger all day, clubs.

* Definite no's - Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Rome, Florence, Nice

* I can't drive on the other side of the road.

I don't *really* mind being alone for my birthday, but I'd love to go somewhere where I could do some kind of special activity or group tour or fun thing on the day. Or least a scene that where there might be lots of other single/non-family travellers my age.

Would be open to joining a tour group or going to some kind of retreat/educational course, but don't want to be with 21 year olds. Sadly FlashPack is too expensive for me.

Vacation Rental Price Changes/Hikes (Airbnb/VRBO/TripAdvisor etc etc,"I've heard of nightmare stories of landlords accepting payments for vacation rentals, only to hike up the price when the traveler is desperate &amp; out of options (soon before arriving). I'm planning a vacation to Hawaii in the winter. On the stories, landlords give excuses like "" it's hard to price into the future for vacation rentals."" or ""I entered the wrong price"".

Do any of these platforms give any protections from property owners that do this?

How exactly does the bait and switch work? Is it trying to take advantage of supply &amp; demand by reducing the vacationer's time to search for a rental?

If the landlord inputs the wrong price, but I already paid for it, who wins under these platforms?

If I see a quoted price, and then pay for it, are there any surprise fees?

Is it rare, and just a part of life I should accept?

Worried about travelling to Mumbai ?,"Hi there 
I wasn’t sure where to post this so I’ve started in this subreddit 
I’m hoping for some advice about an upcoming travel of mine.

Basically my girlfriend works as a makeup artist and so do I and recently since last year with a makeup school in Mumbai.
She’s been flown out there about 4 times now to Bandra West I believe it to be called to teach at the school.

All four times she’s gone I’ve had the offer to go but turned it down as I’m a very anxious traveller despite having been to Thailand once and America / New York And Las Vegas Los Angeles /  a few times a year and most of Europe .... Italy Germany France ect more Western Europe 
I travel frequently with my job and we usually travel together.

My issue here is lately in the last year or so my issues with my anxiety and stomach have been much worse
I currently am going through a process with my undiagnosed “ ibs “
Which has had me housebound for a majority of this year and in the times I have been travelling I’ve been having huge attacks 
Probably due to a mixture of anxiety and worry of not being near a public toilet and just because my stomach cannot digest anything :(

I’ve suffered with this for years I’m 21 almost 22 now and I’ve had it since I was about 12 years old
Usually if I can I turn down travel opportunities out of the uk / London
For my job unless I really have to go 

But my girlfriend has been pushing that I go to Mumbai for a year now and I finally gave in..
I know I probably sound crazy but I’m having a major panic about it.

The only other place I’ve been to is Thailand in Asia and although I loved it 
It wasn’t without it’s issues
I was sick about 3 or 4 times and some of them were when I wasn’t in reach of my hotel and send me into a panic. 

The problem for me is even with my medication of which I carry everywhere 
I can’t always control it 
It could be fine for days and then flare up.

I’m worried that Mumbai May be too much for me to handle and that it won’t have much easy access to toilets in public 

I’m staying in the taj lands end in Mumbai Bandra which yes I know is a gorgeous hotel
And generally other than a few days off we will be going around only the west Bandra area to the makeup school and occasionally out for dinner in the local area

But I know it wouldn’t be worth going to not see south mumbai and the other areas markets and things .. 

I guess I’m looking for some advice as I know from my girlfriend who never usually gets sick
She was sick there twice 
Even though she was in a 5* hotel

I’m stocked up on anti biotics and immodium and buscopan 
But I don’t want my anxiety to ruin this beautiful experience for me :(",travel

Australian Bilateral Visa Waiver question for EU,"Hey there, I'm an Australian citizen that has an upcoming trip to Finland to see my partner planned in a few weeks. Originally it was going to fall under 90 days so didn't look too much into any other visa requirements as I am aware that we could stay in Schengen countries visa-free for 90 days.

But we've extended plans, and will be taking about 3-4 weeks holidays to countries including:Germany, The Netherlands, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Austria and Belgium. This was on top of our plans, meaning I'd then return to Finland for a couple of weeks before we head back to Canada.  
I then fell into a little panic that this would exceed the 90 days maximum - but just found out about the Australians Bilateral Visa Waiver program, where a bunch of these countries still have setup.

Kind of looking for clarification here - but to my understanding, this means in each of the countries listed [Here (scroll to the section)](https://smartraveller.gov.au/bulletins/pages/europe_schengen.aspx) I would get 90 days in EACH of these countries, that would be separate from my 90 days in other Schengen countries?

"[taxi mafia problems - Bali] Unaware of taxi mafia, grabbed Bluebird taxi at echo beach who had just dropped passengers off, pulled out of taxi by locals at check-point, followed on motorbike by mafia","Hi all,

Myself [31, male, Australian] and my wife [28, female, Taiwanese] had just finished enjoying our day at Echo beach, Bali. We had caught a Bluebird (meter taxi) in, and in our naivety had no idea there was a taxi mafia running this beach.

On our way out, we walked down the main street and seen a Bluebird taxi drop off some customers and jumped in. We told him our address and off we went. We got to some apparent check-point on the road, those little bamboo huts where the dodgy-scam taxi drivers sit, and were suddenly blocked and surrounded by 5-6 local men and told to pull over.

The taxi driver opened his window and they exchanged words in a local language. He then turned to me and said he cannot take me. The man outside his window then yelled at me that there can be no metered taxis at this beach. I told the taxi driver to just drive (as it was clear ahead of us at that time) but he was scared. (I said 'meet us down the street' and he agreed, but he drove off never to return. In heinsight, he was terrified).

The local shithead walked to my side of the car and opened my door and said 'get out'. Myself and my wife got out and thought 'no fucking way in hell are we taking these asshole's taxis, fuck that', and walked off down the road.

We walked maybe 0.5 km down some side roads and then seen another Bluebird driving around. Flagged him down, as he was about to come to a stop he instead hastily sped off, and then suddenly a motorbike appeared with tattooed local riders (my wife later told me she recognized them, but was quiet at the time). We walked further up the street, and the same taxi turned around, flashed his lights at us and slowed, but then sped off again as the motorbike approached.

We then decided we had had enough of this and that it was getting potentially dangerous, so we ducked in a bar full of westerners and had a drink. Spoke to some of them, and they informed me of an app (Gojek) to use to get a taxi, and also seemed shocked at the situation. We figured that no way in hell did we want to use these dodgy guy's taxis, after-all if they are this dodgy, just how far will they go? We drank our drinks, ordered a (unmarked) Gojek car, and got the hell out of there.

Summary: We are fucking horrified that locals would actually pull two foreigners out of a taxi, and then follow us. This was extremely confrontational. I don't care if they have their own taxi mafia going, but stop the local taxis before they enter the beach area AND DO NOT INVOLVE OR INTIMIDATE FOREIGN TOURISTS.

This was our second time in Bali, and it will be our last. There have been other scams these past few weeks, and frankly, we are sick of it. Its always a battle here. This isn't how we wanted to spend our holidays.

Thank you for your time.

How do I get an airline to cough up for a bad flight?,"Hey redditors, I have a question for you all. I recently went on what might be a recordbreakingly bad flight from American airlines. What should have been a 7-hour flight in fact took about 15 hours. How do I get the most goodwill compensation from the airline, being as how I missed basically the first day of my trip? Sorry for the formatting, as I am on mobile.

THE STORY:

I was traveling from LAX to the panhandle region of Florida. I had arrived at the airport well on time, and when boarding arrived... No plane. 

The gate crew got on the intercom and said, ""We are sorry for the delay, we have the plane, but it is not here at the gate. We are bringing it over here from the hangar. There is nothing wrong with the plane (she made sure to emphasize this twice), we are just making it over, and we will announce boarding soon."" No problem! Everything takes time. 

After some 20 minutes, they announced a gate change. Again, no prob. The plane arrived at the gate eventually and we didn't board. Another 10 minutes and they announced a mechanical problem. Things start to go off the rails at this point, as they made one or two announcements as to anticipated boarding time, then we heard nothing for 2 hours. We boarded two and a half hours late. By this time I have missed my connecting flight in Dallas. No attempt was made to have anyone waiting in Dallas to discuss rebooking flights, or even a sign pointing us to the customer service desk. They attempted to automatically rebook me on a flight that would have arrived 2 days later - if my girlfriend hadn't gotten online and rebooked it on the one flight going to my destination the same day. 

By any metric, this was a shitshow of a flight. Poor coordination to have the plane waiting, bad communication, extremely poor customer service, and maintenance issues, with no effort to soften the blow or issue compensation on site. when I asked the lady at the customer service desk about this, she referred me to the website. These actions and attitudes are worthy of a county fair lemonade stand, not a billion dollar major US carrier.

 I have nearly given up on American Airlines as a carrier entirely as a result of this and previous delays. I feel that since their performance was such at odds with the reasonable expectations of a major carrier, goodwill compensation is in order. My question is, how do I best get the most goodwill compensation from this airline?",travel

I would love to try to visit Tequisquiapan or Bernal within that time. I would also love to be able to hike the Cimatario National Park. Also, I'm spending more time here because I've been here, so I know the city and there's a lot of detailed things I'd love to try now that I've been here. A lot of good restaurants and foods I want to try here. 

* *San Miguel de Allende* - Saturday Evening-Sunday Evening. I didn't like how San Miguel felt isolated in the middle of nowhere, unlike how Queretaro was extremely huge and busy. But if I'm bringing a group, they're going to want to go somewhere fun on the weekends. 

* *Mexico City* - Sunday Evening-Wednesday Afternoon. I want to spend a decent chunk here because of all the history and culture here. Based on this schedule, I will be missing the nightlife in Mexico City I guess, but that's part of my plan to get a lot of the culture and food from this city. 

_________
**Phase Two - Yucatán Peninsula**

I will be flying from Mexico City to one of the local airports in the Yucatán Peninsula. I will be spending the rest of the trip there visiting small towns and ruins and relaxing on the beach for the end of the trip. 

I'm hoping to get the deep peninsula stuff done during the weekdays first so that we can spend the rest of the week + weekend enjoying the beach and bars that will be busy during the weekend. 

* *Valladolid* - Wednesday Evening-Friday Morning. We'll land in one of the airports, not sure which one yet, and then try to get to Vallodolid as soon as possible. Try some food, get some drinks on the first night and then find a hotel. The main thing close by without having to make another city stop is Chichén Itzá, we can spend all of Thursday morning and afternoon there, easily. Then maybe try to visit Cenote Dzitnup and Convent of San Bernardino of Siena on the way back to the coastal cities. Not worth leaving Thursday night, might as well gain a couple hours of nightlife and then drive back to Tulum on Friday morning.  

* *Tulum* - Friday Morning-Saturday Afternoon. Beach day, spend some time on the beautiful beaches, try some of the Caribbean Mexican food that I keep hearing about out of this region. Get some beers on the beach.

* *Playa Del Carmen* - Saturday Afternoon-Sunday. Last day of the trip! Enjoy some night life in a popular town where it might be good, especially on a Saturday. Spend the last day on the beach to relax from all the fast paced travel from the last few days. 

Leave Mexico on Sunday :(

______________


Has anyone done something like this? We'll be going by bus for the longer distances, or by Ubers for the shorter distances. Are these cities good for nightlife? I'm trying to plan it so that the decent nightlife cities are on a Friday/Saturday, and the cities that would be historical/cultural are on the weekdays. I'm trying to do all this and keep it cost effective. 

There may be 4 people total. Are there other cities that I should maybe spend a day checking out along the way? Any tips for a large scale trip like this? Any specific restaurants or foods I should try in each of these cities? Is there something else that I maybe don't know about in Queretaro? 

I'll take any feedback right now.",travel
Cheap phone that is used for not much more than photos!,"Hey there,

I am going travelling next week and my old phone has decided it's time to pack up. I thought it's probably good timing as the camera wasn't up to the quality I wanted. I tossed up  between lugging around my Canon DSLR but have since decided against it... trying to travel light.

"[Problem, Italy] Hotel Owner wants to go to the police over cancellation fees","Hi, This post i'm just asking for advice on how to proceed. 

I booked a trip in Italy through Expedia, but the hotel owner overbooked his hotel. We got a message around 4 weeks after booking stating we won't have a room to stay in. So the guy from the hotel called us and said we can't put you in the room you paid for but we can put you in a hotel next door, but the hotel next door (100$/night) wasn't close to the one we booked (220$/night) and he wasn't willing to pay the difference per night between hotels. So we told him we were not thrilled with the idea of staying there, so we called expedia and they were already aware of the situation and that the hotel owner offered us the stay at a different hotel, so they got us a new hotel with the same amenities as the original that we booked. This morning I get a call from the original hotel owner saying he's going to go to the italian authorities over unpaid cancellation fees and that when we land in italy for our vacation there is going to be a problem.

I haven't answered him yet, but is there any advice you would give me before proceeding?

I'm booking a Round The World ticket in October and I need some feedback on the itinerary,"So, I'm planning a RTW trip for the month of October. I have a month between 2 jobs and I'd like to visit a few places before starting. I'm buying a business class RTW ticket with Star Alliance (so I can sleep on the plane in between destinations and not waste time re-adjusting after every 12 hours leg).

Does my itinerary make sense? Any tip or anything wrong with it I should take into account? Any place I'm over-staying? I know I'm under-staying in a lot of places, but I only have one month.

About me – I am a solo traveller (but with friends in over 50% of the destination cities), mid 30s, very used to travelling, not on a budget. I like big cities and I love any kind of food, my travels often revolve around it. I am skipping the continental US as I've been there a ton of times, same applies for Europe since I was born here. No time for Africa or LATAM (not really into solo travelling in LATAM tbh).

Here's the itinerary, let me know what you think. Thanks!

I'm open to changes within the same area or adding/removing days to my destinations.

Sept/Oct Chile Recommendations?,"Hi there, first time poster here.I’m traveling to Chile in a few months and am hoping to get any suggestions, recommendations or feedback on our plans.  We’ve asked around but have a hard time finding anyone who’s been to Chile.

The beginning part of the trip is already planned - we’ll be spending the first few days in Valpo (at the Winebox). From there we want to go to the Lake District and the Central Valley, and will have 6 to 7 days to cover these areas before we have to be back in Santiago. 

Knowing it will be late winter/early spring, we’re hoping to do some hiking, visit some wineries, and see the scenery.  We’re happy to splurge on nice accommodations and good food but otherwise mid range options are generally where we land. We prefer less crowded/less touristy areas. 

For anyone who lives in the area or has been, are there any must sees? Any places we should look into staying at (we like B&amp;B style accommodations), or recommendations for transport?  Would you suggest going somewhere else in Chile besides these two areas? 

Happy to provide more info too. Thanks!",travel

Argentina and Chile in under a month,"Hey guys,

I need some advice by the South America aficionados here to make the most out of my travel. A few words about me: late twenties, male, European, don't speak any Spanish (but planning to do at least a beginners course before the trip), will be traveling alone. No fixed budget, working full time but not rich.

I want to do South America in mid November to December, probably 3 weeks plus a few days. I already narrowed it down to Argentina/Chile/(Bolivia maybe), because there's no way to do the entire continent in that time. I love hiking and natural wonders, but also like strolling through interesting cities. 

What I'm missing is 

a) What else to see than just Patagonia (already locked in), preferably something with a bit of contrast. Two ideas below, but would love any other suggestions.

b) a feeling for the distances and an understanding of how easy and fast traveling longer distances is (road quality, bus connections, flight frequency).

A very preliminary rough itinerary could look like this:

- 2 days in Buenos Aires, then fly to El Calafete
- 10 days hiking and sight seeing in this part of Patagonia (Glaciar Perito Moreno, Torres de Paine, Fitz Roy, ...), maybe with a rental car? Fly out to Salta or somewhere else around there.
- 9 days road trip (public transport?) for Atacama desert / El Tatio Geysirs / Bolivian salt flats (maybe just some of those plus something else that is closer by), then back to Buenos Aires and home. 

Adding a few days for the flights, that should be a good 3 weeks. A different itinerary could also be adding Tierra del Fuego and/or Peninsula Valdes and skipping the North-West partly or entirely.

I'd be happy to hear any ideas on where to go, what to do, and most importantly on ""this is impossible, don't do this"" when looking at my time constraint and distances. General advice on car rentals (4x4?), bus connections, border crossings, and whatever you feel is important is also highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot in advance!",travel
"[xpost from solo travel] good destination for a surprise trip for my 50-year-old mom, alone?","Hi!  I posted this on a thread in solo travel, but haven't had any responses, so thought I'd try here:

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's 50th birthday is coming up, and my family wants to send her on an all-expense-paid trip for a week. She hasn't traveled much internationally (but very much wants to and absolutely loved a trip to Eastern Europe about 30 years ago), so it'd be the trip of a lifetime for her.  But I also want to make sure it's somewhere she feels safe traveling alone and that is easy to navigate (and friendly toward!) a solo, 50 year old american who only speaks English.  She's a big walker and I think would rather not drive in a foreign country.  She loves trying different foods, sightseeing, museums, etc.  She prefers cooler climates and doesn't really care about the beach/tropics.  She's also a little intimidated by big cities, having spent most of her life in a rural part of Western Washington.  (But I still think a city would be okay, as long as it was somewhere that felt safe on her own.)

&amp;#x200B;

Can you suggest a good destination for her? I was thinking New Zealand or Ireland maybe?  Anytime is okay, and the budget is no more than $4k, including airfare from the PNW.

Duffle bag dilemma,"My wife and I are flying American in a few days. We have large duffle bags that we love to travel with because they hold everything we could possibly need. We've never taken them flying but we are going to be gone for 2 weeks and would love to use them and avoid purchasing new luggage. 

The question is, with hard luggage you get the dimensions. Max allowable size without the 200 dollar fee is 62inches. With our duffle bags we measure 63 inches if it's filled to capacity. They are not meaning the height of the bag compresses and makes the total size about 60 inches. Does that matter? 

As far as I'm concerned if the luggage compresses that saves space and it shouldn't be measured as if there is stuff in it. But also don't want to pay 200 dollars per bag both ways.

Canadians travelling to Cuba for the first time with layover in Mexico City and peanut allergy,"Hi /r/travel,


After some research, my partner and I have decided on Havana as a between semester trip this winter between Dec14th and Dec 23rd. We are salsa dancers, food lovers, fans of history &amp; culture and lovers of the shoreline and snorkeling. We are beyond excited at the prospect of this trip satiating bits of all the above. Our flight is through aeromexico has a 12hr layover in Mexico City on departure and 9h layover on return. We were hoping to turn the wait into day trips as we will be arriving in MEX 6am and 8am respectively.

We were hoping for affordable and most importantly safe guidance in leaving the airport to explore the authentic mexico city (within reason of course). I'm a big fan of food but am worried about logistically visiting central de abastos, etc. This brings me to my girlfriend's peanut allergy. We will have several laminated wallet cards in Spanish about her anaphylactic peanut allergy. How worried should we be in Mexico City and Havana respectively?


Finally, Our rough itinerary thus far in Havana is: Salsa lessons in Havana during the day, some socials at night, habana vieja, museums, malecon, vinales horse tours, air bnb experience snorkel tours and a day of churches and architecture walking.


For those that have been, is it advised to plan day trips to Vinales or trinidad from Havana or stay 1 or 2 nights at a casa particular instead? Will we have resistance or troubles trying to eat like locals using CUP vs CUC? Is renting a local tour guide for a day or two recommended? Our spanish is very basic at best. 


We are definitely open to more options for destinations, experiences or adventures so please fire away if you are a local or recent visitor!


Finally, I've read some conflicting information about gifting or donating to the Cuban people. We are not wealthy by any means but I do have 2016 era electronics like the G5 gathering dust. Are we contributing to an inequality or tourist problem by bringing tampons, shampoos, gift shop trinkets and electronics or is simply CUC tips the way the go?

Best one-way car rental company / partner website in USA? Vegas - LA - San Francisco Trip,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for a bit of advice as I'm a bit confused by the dozen of car rental companies and partner/compare prices websites. I'm coming from Europe and I am planing a trip on the US West Coast. This is the itinerary for car rental:

1. 2 days in Las Vegas (TURO app) for visiting the Grand Canyon and exploring the city
2. 1 day for moving Las Vegas - Los Angeles **?**
3. 5 days in Los Angeles (TURO app) 
4. 1 day for moving Los Angeles - San Francisco **?**
5. 4 days in San Francisco (TURO app)

The recommendations I'm looking for are for one way trip between cities since for mostly everything else I will use TURO, really low prices and nice cars, but since they are personal possessions you can't leave it in another city so I'll have to use other companies for this.

* I am 23 years old with a 5 year old valid drivers licence so I will pay the 'young tax &lt;25yo' whatever the company but that's no issue
* I don't mind changing so many cars, I'll pick them up and leave them at the airport in each location at the same day

So, any positive experiences with any airport companies / websites that are user friendly and no hidden and decent costs? I liked how easy the Sixt app makes it but it's pretty expensive, e.g. 1 day renting a basic car between Vegas - LA is 220$ +. Now looking through those mentioned websites (e.g. [rentalcars.com](https://rentalcars.com), [easyrentcars.com](https://easyrentcars.com) ) I can see much better prices but there are so many companies and websites that I don't know which one should I trust with my money.

"10-11 months travelling/working around Australia (working holiday visa), NZL, Canada, U.S., and South America - Any advice?","I've just graduated university in the U.K. and I'm working in London for the summer. I want to take a year out before I go into full-time employment, hopefully in September 2020, to travel/work and just get some life experience. I've saved around £4000 so far, and want to leave the U.K. with a minimum of £6000 by the end of September/early October, but will aim for £7000.

Just a side note, I can't *legally* drive as I don't have my license yet.  


This is a very general plan and I'm just looking for any advice/criticism etc. particularly regarding the working holiday visa (WHV) and the Americas.  


**Australia/New Zealand - 4-6 months**

I'm being optimistic and hoping I will be able to almost break-even whilst in Australia as I won't need to pay for accomodation (friends around the country, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide) and will be able to find a job (mines, farms, pub/bar work etc). I've heard of quite a few people actually making a profit whilst on the WHV. I'll probably spend the majority of my time in Australia, around 5-6 months, starting in October.

&amp;#x200B;

I would head out to NZL around December time (have some family there) and just do some fun touristy things (bungee jump, white water rafting etc.) but I'd only spend a couple weeks there and treat it more of a holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

**Canada - 1.5 months (approx)**

I'll be doing a homestay in Canada whilst playing rugby for a club in Ontario for around 6 weeks, so I don't expect to spend a great deal. I'm also going to try and work part-time. I won't be doing too much travelling during this period as I'm mainly going there to play rugby.   


**U.S. - 0-14 days (?)**

After finishing up in Ontario, I'd love to see a bit of the U.S., but I'm not sure how feasible it is. This is where my plan is a bit muddled.

I would finish in Canada around mid-late May/ early-June time and I've got a couple options:

1. Meet my mate in North Carolina and head straight down to South America with him and virtually not do any of the U.S.
2. Meet him in Florida and spend a week there going to theme parks, and just having a bit of fun before heading to South America
3. Travel down the East Coast for around 2 weeks, staying at friend's places before meeting my mate and travelling down to South America
4. 2 week long road trip across the states (?) - not sure if I'll have enough time/money for this
5. Fly from Canada and meet my mate in South America and just skip the U.S. completely
6. Other options??

&amp;#x200B;

**South America - 2 months (?)**

Regarding South America, I'd probably stick towards the West. I really want to go to Bolivia and see the salt planes, hike in Chile, go to Peru and see Machu Picchu, and go along the Amazon river. I'd probably start in Chile (?) as it makes sense geographically, and move my way up through each place either via bus or plane.

&amp;#x200B;

**Central America?**

It would be very cool to head to Mexico, Belize and other parts of Central America but once again, not sure how feasible it would be as I would want to return to the UK for mid-August

Going to Japan for 3rd time: Worth heading all the way south by Okinawa?,"I am going to Japan for 10 days and have a completely open itinerary.  I've been to Japan twice before and my first trip, I did the standard Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.  My 2nd trip, I had 3 weeks to spend to I did Osaka, Tokyo, Kyoto, northern Japan (Sapporo, Hakodate, etc), and down briefly to Hiroshima.

Should I spend this trip going all the way south to Okinawa and Naha or explore more of Tokyo and middle of Japan?   I hear Okinawa is quite different but I'm also not a 'beach' person and I know it's a lot of beaches so I'm conflicted.",travel

In 3 weeks we start our 5 weeks road trip from one park to another on the west coast. We plan to camp on campgrounds in the parks, but I'm afraid it might be fully booked.

"Traveling to Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India - need advice","Hello!

It was just sprung on me that I’m heading to Chennai for work in a week; I’ve done a travel physical and got all the medication and vaccinations completed as recommended by my doctor. Been recommended to avoid ice, raw, and undercooked food. My doctor ordered me to bring sunscreen, insect repellent, sunglasses, and to take a lot of photos.

I’m confused on clothing, culture, and currency. I’ve been told and read p to pack long-sleeve shirts and wear pants - and that it’s better to pack lightly and buy clothes on arrival - and that’s about it. I also have no idea about money - is Visa/Mastercard common, or should I withdraw cash beforehand and convert it to rupees? How much would $100 USD go?

The tldr is that my place *of employment* hasn’t provided much detail with this trip - most of the information I have has come from my doctor who wants to ensure my safety - and I want to ensure that I respect the local culture as much as I can once I arrive.

I know India is culturally diverse and that Chennai is a melting pot, I just haven’t found much in the way for travel tips there.",travel

Anxiety about Japanese culture,"Hi /r/travel, I'm travelling with a group of friends to Japan in 13 days (18th of July) and have just started getting nervous about the culture there (This is my first time going to Japan so I'm not sure what to expect). I have a few questions to ask people who hopefully have more experience travelling [to Japan] than me, more for my own peace of mind than anything.

1) I've learned a small amount of hiragana but have never seriously tried to learn much Japanese. Is it worth trying to really study/learn the language in the 13 days before I leave? I consider myself reasonably adept at learning languages but I also know learning the characters itself is a massive task and I know I wouldn't get very far anyway, but maybe it would help some. One of my friends speaks a fair amount of Japanese so I'm not concerned for my ability to navigate, but more about coming off as rude, which leads into my next question.

2) We're travelling in a group of 4, three of whom are from China while I'm very white (blond hair/blue eyes), and I'm a little self conscious about sticking out and I'm not sure what to expect, since I've heard Japan can be slightly xenophobic (although I've heard especially xenophobic to non-Japanese Asians so I'm not sure). Is there anything I should do to be more culturally conscious so I don't offend anyone or come off as some rude white westerner?

Maybe my getting nervous isn't making a reddit post about but some information might make me feel better. My main two concerns are the language and not making a fool of myself, as above. Also I'm sorry if I've said something offensive; I'm just trying to learn and don't want to be rude.",travel

"What is the point of travel insurance, if they ""we will not pay for"" pretty much anything, is this all a rip off that nobody talks about?","Hi all,
After going over 4 different insurance companies, reading their 50-page long policy booklet.

I came to a conclusion, what is the point of buying travel insurance anyway? 

One example is: ""We will not pay for"": From **Zurich**
(Trip delay and missed departure)The claim that is for

1. a) the withdrawal of an aircraft, cross-channel train or sea vessel from
service (temporarily or permanently) on the recommendation or order of any
government, civil aviation authority, port authority, rail authority or similar
authority in any country;
1. b) closure of airspace;
1. c) closure of your scheduled point of departure; and/or
1. d) storm or severe snowfall,
unless section 13 ‘Catastrophe, natural disaster and airspace closure’ is shown in
your statement of insurance, where cover will apply as set out in that section
of your policy.
1. Any claim if your delay in getting to the departure point was caused by industrial
action which started or was announced before you bought the travel tickets or got
confirmation of your booking.
1. Any claim which is the result of any form of industrial action, strike or failure of public
transport announced on television, news bulletins or in the media in the UK before
you booked a trip and bought this insurance.
1.  Any claim which is the result of your private car not being fully roadworthy before
breaking down on the way to your departure point.
1.  Any claim which is the result of you missing your departure because of heavy traffic 

**So my question is what tf it does cover? Wouldn't it be simpler for them to just say ""we cover these situations and other than that is a no""**

**Another example** for some other policy ""apparently really good "" **Travelex**
They cover for Accidental Death and Dismemberment:
We will not cover for : Loss caused by or resulting directly or indirectly from sickness or disease of any kind;stroke or cerebrovascular accident or event; cardiovascular accident or event; myocardial infarction or heart attack; coronary thrombosis; aneurysm.

* So another question what accidental death it does cover ?? If meteorite falls on me or car hit me ? (it might say something about car in some other section that it excudes it aswell) So basically i get covered for accidental death meaning if i get sickness or disease going abroad i will be covered &gt;&gt; nope your wrong...

* Seems like complete bs to me, i dont know maybe you guys tell me something which insurance do you guys use and do you also spend days before trip reading policies because they are so complicated and so hard to read that probably it covers all but when you get deeper into policy it covers nothing.

Or **Allianz**, it was simplest most logical policy booklet i read i think, all clear and layout nicely was happy last page all good finally will buy insurance... just to find out right at the very end last page a surprise "" we are covering only these airlines "" boom just like 10 major airlines, no china southern, no air Asia, no philipine airlines, just big major ones american, Norwegian, British etc are you guys serious ??

Do you really buy insurance, is it really worth it, what does it cover tho if from what i read it covers nothing, is it complete bs rip off people or its actually useful?

Tell me your opinion guys on travel insurance and if you use which do you use and why ?

Thanks for help !",travel

Where to go if I absolutely love Iceland but want to go somewhere new?,"Been to Iceland 3 times over the last 3 years. Have spent about 4 months there total. Have been to every single part of the country except the deep interior, which I still want to do. Spent a month and a half living in a remote part of the West Fjords.

Have driven the ring road, the west fjords, nightmarishly terrifying dirt roads on the sides of cliffs, all in winter. I love everything about it except the expense.

What do you think about a climate tax for flying?,"Scientists are very clear on the negative impact that flying has on the planet.

I am a traveler with my heart and soul. And I love that flying is affordable af.  You can now fly from Europe to Bangkok and back for 1/5th of your monthly salary. Or if you have a ryan air deal you can fly for the price of a fancy dinner from North to South Europe. 

If there were no side effects, I think I would travel every other day. But by crossing continents you are simultaneously melting off the equivalent of [3sqm+ ice in the arctics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/11/03/heres-how-much-of-the-arctic-youre-personally-responsible-for-melting/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7c1d705e1e0dsomething) though. And that to me means the pricing is not right. 

A climate tax could be used to neutralize the negative effect flying has by planting forests or similar projects that improve sustainablility.

"Switzerland on 65 USD per day, including transportation, food, and lodging. Am I forgetting something or is this fairly reasonable?","I'm going to Switzerland next week for 13 days. Despite most people saying it's impossible to visit Switzerland on a budget, I think I might've organized a fairly reasonable itinerary.

**Itinerary**

Day 1: Land in Zurich at 8am. Explore the city for a little bit (I hear there's not much to see). Take the train to Lucerne at ~3pm and explore the city and surroundings. Sleep at the Lucerne campsite.

Day 2: Leave Lucerne early and take the train to Geneva, then take a bus to Chamonix, France. Do nature stuff there. Sleep at Chamonix campsite. 

Day 3: Do more nature stuff in Chamonix, watch the finals of the Lead Climbing World Cup in Chamonix at night. Sleep at Chamonix campsite.

Day 4: Leave Chamonix, head to Montreux. Explore the city and surroundings. Sleep at Montreux riviera campsite

Day 5: Leave Montreux, visit relatives in a small town East of Montreux. Spend the night there.

Day 6: Head to Bern, explore the city and surroundings. Sleep in a campsite outside the city.

Day 7: Head to Interlaken, explore the town and surroundings. Sleep in a campsite there.

Day 8: Visit Lauterbrunnen, explore the town and surroundings. Sleep either there or in Interlaken.

Day 9: Head to Zermatt. Explore town and surroundings. Camp there.

Day 10: Take the Glacier Express from Zermatt to St Moritz, Sleep in a campsite there. This one I'm doubtful of. I don't think I want to do the full 8 hours on the train if all I want to really see is the Landwasser Viaduct.

Day 11: Take a train to Linthal, hike a trail there to a lake up in the mountains where I'm planning on wild camping for the night (from what I've researched, it's a myth that there's a blanket ban on wild camping in Switzerland. It's legal if you only stay for one night and do it above the treeline).

Day 12: Head back to Zurich (still figuring out what I can do this day, all I know for sure is I need to sleep in Zurich to make it to my flight early the next day.

Day 13: Fly out at 7:30am.

**Budgeting**

Swiss Travel Pass Youth - 15 days = 445 USD
I'm going to be moving around *a lot*, so I'll be getting good value of out of the travel pass. This pass also includes access to most cable cars and museums.

Food= 15 USD x 12 days = 180 USD
I'll probably be eating a lot of ramen, oatmeal, eggs, bread with nutella, and maybe I'll get fancy and cook a burger a couple of times. This would usually be ~5-8 USD per day in a normal country, but because it's Switzerland I'll double it. Eating like this cost me ~10 USD per day in Iceland, also a very expensive country. This number might go a bit higher depending on how much beer I drink while I'm there. 

Lodging in Switzerland = 20 USD x 9 nights = 180 USD
Campsites seem to range from 13 USD to 25 USD per night. I'm erring on the safe side with 20 USD per night. I'm also not counting the one night I stay with relatives here, and the one night wild camping.

Lodging in Chamonix = 13 USD x 2 nights = 26 USD

**Total** = 831 USD or 63 USD per day.


Expenses I may not have considered yet: SIM card, reservation for Glacier Express, bus from Geneva to Chamonix and back. 

Thanks to the Travel Pass, I get a flexibility with where I want to be and when, so this itinerary is 100% subject to change and would vary depending on if I meet people I like and/or find new interesting plans. Any thoughts and comments are appreciated!!",travel
