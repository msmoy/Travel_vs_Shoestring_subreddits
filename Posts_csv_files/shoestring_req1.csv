Looking for a mini getaway trip.,"You’re traveling with your SO this Fall and have never been outside of NM, TX and LA. He enjoys driving, so a road trip could be fun, but don’t want more than 1 days worth.  

A healthy mixture of the nature scene (maybe something adventurous like jumping out of a helicopter, paragliding anything to give you an adrenaline rush), but also enjoy the night life so can’t be too far away (Maybe not more than 45 mins) from city night life. 

Here’s what you have to work with...
People: 2
Duration: 3-5 days 
Season: fall (early September to late December)
Budget: $1000-$2500 shared expenses


Is it best to rent a hotel, airbnb or camp through the getaway?
What options would you consider for food? How much would you budget to spend? 

I’m super new to planning and open to all of your suggestions!",Shoestring
Emergency travel - Standby ticket?,"Hi everyone,

My little sister was involved in a car accident across the country. I need to get there as soon as possible but flights are around $500 and I can't afford that. Are there any cheaper options for same-day or next-day travel? I can wait around the airport if need be. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: route is ATL to MSP

Edit 2: I called Delta, JetBlue, American and United. Everyone except delta said they don’t offer a bereavement fare and Delta said I was eligible for their bereavement fare but quoted me $1,968 when the online fare for the same flights runs at $551. I can’t say how much I appreciate the kind help and support from you all. Im going to keep looking and will update",Shoestring
Should I ditch my greyhound ticket for a plane one ?,"So I will be going on a trip soon, it's my first time ever really traveling, and I had decided to go by Greyhound. But after looking around it seems flying would be less headache and about the same price. I only didn't consider flying becauae I asummed it to be quite expensive and stressful to go alone on my first time boarding one. I know I can't get my money back but I want this trip to be as smooth as possible.",Shoestring

January Winter Wonderland European Destinations?,"Looking for destinations in Europe including eastern countries that have a picturesque town feel, with snow, and winter based activities like sleigh ride, tobogganing, hot pools/springs/tubs etc. Skiing isn’t essential but we’d have a go if there was a nearby option. We will most likely will be traveling the first or second week of January. Would love to go just before Christmas but it’s more important to us to be in a town with snow or have access to snow easily than it is to have a White Christmas. We may have five or six people to accommodate. 
Destinations that are more budget friendly would be great.",Shoestring

Traveling with a baby?,"Hi!
I’d like to take my husband somewhere for his birthday in/around early October.
We will be traveling with our one year old.

Any suggestions on cheap destinations that have a public transit system from the airport to the city? (We don’t want to rely on Uber with a baby...)

We live in PHL, but can easily travel from Newark, Baltimore, Atlantic City, Trenton, Allentown. Would prefer to avoid LaGuardia and JFK. 

International travel is not out of the question.

Airlines Cracking Down on Carry-On Bag Sizes?,Just got stopped while I was checking in at a kiosk by an AA employee. They told me I had to check my bag that was a hair too big for their carry-on sizes. I asked about people that bring large 50+ L camping backpacks as carry-ons and she said they're going to start charging at the gates to check those. Is she just telling me that so I don't try it or are airlines actually cracking down on oversized carry-on bags?,Shoestring
Amsterdam,"Hiya,  


I don't normally do the more normal travell-y stuff (I hitchhike and camp in more rural places, don't spend much time in cities), so this sort of planning is out of my league. I'm meeting a few friends I haven't seen for years, and won't see for a while again in Amsterdam for 4 days in August. I wanted to spend more time in Amsterdam for a first visit, and suggested somewhere, but one of them has dreamed of going there since they were a child, so fair play to that.   


I'm not used to figuring out where to stay as a tourist. There's loads of options on airbnb and hostelworld, but it's a little overwhelming figuring out where is a good location. Personally I'd like to get out of amsterdam a bit, everyone says to make sure you see outside the center. So would it be sensible to stay somewhere cheaper out of the center? If it's no more than an hour to commute into the city, that might be acceptable for the others in a group. And it might make our costs better.. trying to keep things under £20 a night each for a bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on a nice area to look for accomodation that's not going to be a nightmare to get into the center to do the more typical attractions my friend will be interested in?

Thanks!",Shoestring

I will help you find you cheap flights for free since I have nothing else to do (again). ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"I have a hobby of aviation and finding cheap airfare. I thought rather than just looking at random flights I could do something fun and pay something forward. Give me your flights in something like this format the more specific the better. 

\* Origin: ex. NYC (JFK, EWR, LGA)

\* DEST: ex. Miami/FLL

\* Departure Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20

\* Return Dates: ex. 7/1 or 7/1-&gt;7/20. IF One-way just say NA

\* LENGTH: ex. 4 days (If you say 1 week please say 7 days or 7-8 days ect.)

\* Other: ex No Layovers over 4 hours.

\* Expected Budget: \~$120 (Just want to see if I can get below this goal)

\* Bags: Carry-On (Goes in the overhead bin)? Personal Item (fits under the seat in front of you)? Checked Bag? This actually matters in the difference in price alot. EX. 1 carry-on, no checked bags.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15-&gt;7/30 is better than ""Late July""

Also if want to do it yourself. ITA, theflightdeal, Hopper, Momondo, Google Flights and Kayak, KIWI ( typically great for more IDK where to go moments) are great sites.",Shoestring
Is BusBud legitimate?,"Looking to travel solo from Chicago to DC/NYC/Boston for next spring break.

I found BusBud and it's significantly cheaper for certain routes vs flying, Amtrak, Greyhound, and Megabus. For example, a ticket from CHI -&gt; NYC is $46 vs $74 for flying, which is the next cheapest.

Greece and Italy for a belated honeymoon trip,"Husband (24M) and I (29F) are looking to do a week-10 days in each country next May for our five year anniversary. 

Looking for suggestions on which country to start in and where/how to rent a motorbike. Is it feasible to ride up and around the peninsula to get to the next one? 

What are your top stops for couples that just like hiking and exploring? Will there be laundromats available in most towns? We will be traveling with just our backpacks. Would it be worth it/safe/legal to bring camping supplies or will be need solid lodging every night? I saw on another post that ladies can stay in convents in Italy, do they have a male equivalent? (Not that we want to be apart the whole time, but I’d separate for a shower if I’m camping the rest of the time lol) Any special lodging recommendations in Greece?

First time solo travel on the west coast.,"Hi r/shoestring, first time poster here. I'm M(24) based out of Atlanta and looking to take  my first solo trip in September for the Labor Day weekend (8/30 through 9/2). I have never been to the west coast so I my preference lies there. I am okay to save costs by staying in hostels, etc but open to spending the $ for a good experience. 

I would like to explore a major city and do a day long hike in a state/national park. The caveat is I am not that comfortable driving alone so it is kinda important that the city is pedestrian/bike/public transit friendly and the state park is accessible by public transit/Uber/bike. If it helps, I'm not big on the clubbing/nightlife thing but I do enjoy breweries and places with live music. This is just a nice-to-have.

Any suggestions with accommodation (this is the part I have little to no experience in) tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance and happy to provide more information.

Travel destinations within the US,"I wanted to do something for my birthday (end of August) and take a ~4 day trip with my SO. He hasn't been on a plane since he was a baby so I'd like to limit it to a 3 hour flight max or a less than 8 hour drive (live in South FL). 

Within the U.S. since he doesn't have a passport.


I was thinking maybe Colorado for green reasons, or Portland. Calofornia seems nice, but pricey.


Where do you recommend?

We aren't big drinkers
We would be interested in nature activities
Maybe a theme park or somewhere with a lazy river lol
Any out of the ordinary museum (I've always wanted to go to the Mutter Museum but I'm not sure what else there is to do in that town)
I'd love to keep it under $400 per person but I know flights eat up most of that... though we also don't have a car, so I guess a rental would be pricey too.
All recommendations welcome (though maybe not Orlando, I used to live there and we wanna go somewhere we haven't been before)

Based on the times and distances given to me, some of what I thought was doable wasn't lol.

Three girls hitchhiking through northern Italy,"Hello!

Me and my two girl friends (all 19 years old) decided to take a three weeks trip to Italy, starting tomorrow. We're from Czech republic.

We'll hitchike the whole way, first we go to small village Tarvisio, then Udine (to see the sea!), then Florence and finally Milano. We plan to stay in the cities for a few days and maybe stop in some small villages/towns on the way.

We're on a really low budget, so we definitely won't stay in any camps or hostels. Our only shot is couchsurfing, but we're not really successfull so far. Also we can't carry a tent, so we'll just have sleeping bags and mats.
